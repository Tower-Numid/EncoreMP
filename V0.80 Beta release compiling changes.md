## 3.1, Enchanting
`openmw\enchanting.cpp`
`openmw\spellutil.cpp`

- Changed the enchanting capacity of items by altering the equation to generate on a curve by introducing a SQRT to the equation. No other changes involved, all relevant code is within the `int Enchanting::getMaxEnchantValue() const` function.
	- Enchanting.cpp now requires `cmath` in the header to use the SQRT function.
		- Relies on `cmath`
	- There is a check to ensure that that SQRT equation will be skipped and instead 0 is returned, if the game detects an item has (somehow) got a capacity of -5 or less. The use of the SQRT would return unexpected behaviour in these situations otherwise. Should never be a problem if the game is being modded as intended (with values of 0 and above).
- Added a 0.25x multiplier to on-hit item charge costs before they go into the on-use equation in `spellutil.cpp`, this function is hosted in `enchanting.cpp` as `int Enchanting::getEffectiveCastCost() const`
	- Interaction with `spellutil.cpp`
- Added various enchantment point cost modifiers to spell effects and spell schools, to allow independent balancing of spell effects from player spellmaking and alchemy
	- Majority (all?) hosted in `float Enchanting::getEnchantPoints(bool precise) const`
	- `const auto magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);` required to function
	- If check for cast when strikes, which doubles the enchantment point cost. Done for balancing reasons to position on-hit enchantments as having many more uses than in core, with lower potential damage. With other balancing implemented this caps enchantable damage at about 10-30 or 15-35, which rivals artefact damage output (such as Goldbrand, which does 10-30 fire damage per hit)
	- If check for destruction and restoration schools, doubling their enchantment point cost for all items. Done for balancing reasons, to limit the players ability to spam healing or on touch damaging items with otherwise can trivialise the game
		- Gets spell effect school via `int school = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;` and then checks for `if (school == 2 || school == 5)` which are destruction and restoration respectively. If either are found it doubles the point cost. This stacks with all other multipliers such as the cost increase for on-hit weapons
	- If checks for specific spell effects implemented in the same way, in the format ` if (effenumid == 57 || effenumid == 74...` See mechanics changelog for which spells were adjusted in this way
		- `int effenumid = effect.mEffectID;` in code block required to function
		- These modifiers stack with the school and on-hit modifiers above. All modifiers stack unless otherwise noted. All implemented for balancing reasons.
- Enchanting difficulty (success chance) modified for each enchanting type, with the aim of broadly restricting enchantments beyond 20 points by making them disproportionately difficult
	- See the entire `int Enchanting::getEnchantChance() const`. Extensively modified success rates by making difficulty increase in intervals at around 20 and beyond, and by making success rates higher when making low end enchantments (below 5 points)
	- Otherwise however the actual core success rate equation is unchanged, it is still the one listed for open morrowind. All of the difficulty adjustments made are post-hoc, to the success rate generated by that equation
	- `const float enchantpointsforpenalty = getEnchantPoints();` defined in block for point value checks
	- `fEnchantmentConstantChanceMult` no longer used at all
	- Code block on lines 547-549 is required to get the base skill of the players enchanting (ignoring buffs or drain/damage effects), which is used to determine constant effect success rate
	- `"mechanicsmanagerimp.hpp"`, `"../mwclass/creature.hpp"`, and `"../mwworld/player.hpp"` now required in header to get the base skill value (actually I don't think they all are, I got lazy and pasted in all three instead of checking)
	- Constant effects now require a base (unmodified) enchanting skill of 75 to be made, any skill value below this has a 0% success chance. At 75 you can make up to 30 points of CE with guaranteed success rate, and above 30 the chance drops to 0% again. The amount you can make increased in 15 point increments for every 5 skill levels, reaching 90 CE points at 95 skill. At 100 skill all constant effect enchantments succeed regardless of point cost.
	- On-use and on-strike effects are easier to make below 5 points, and become significantly harder beyond 20 and 25 points. 30 is a practical hard cap if you stay within the 200 max skill level allowed by the tes3mp server setup. You can get higher otherwise with buffs, but it was balanced around the assumption you won't.
	- Cast-once (scrolls) use the same logic, but with an additional flat +25% success rate to position them as low level enchanting items (and to provide a practical way to train the skill when starting at very low skill levels)
- Ammunition will now enchant in batches of 20 if the Openmw setting is turned on (set it to `0.5` just in case, but the behaviour should now be value independent as long as it is turned on at all, i.e. greater than 0 in the config file)
	- Within `int Enchanting::getEnchantItemsCount() const`;
		- `count = std::min(itemsInInventoryCount, std::max(1, 20));` replaces the previous check for the enchantment cost and the multiplier settings, fixing the number it will attempt at up to 20 if you are holding them
	- Within `float Enchanting::getTypeMultiplier() const`
		- Fixed to `return 0.05f;`, reducing difficulty by x20
- Enchanting costs modified within `int Enchanting::getEnchantPrice() const` as described in the mechanics section. Very different behaviour to core.

---
	`TES3MP\apps\openmw\spellutil.cpp`
- Changed the on-use cost of enchanted items to involve a logarithm. Intentionally designed the equation to cap cost reduction to 1/3 (more for on-hit effects), and for there to be no penalty at 0 skill.
	- Achieved by making changes to the `int getEffectiveEnchantmentCastCost` function
	- An if check first caps skill player skill at 200, and floors it at 1, to stop unexpected behaviour with the log equation
	- Then a log equation performs the new cost reduction
	- This relies on the `std::log` function so `cmath` is now called in the header
		- Relies on `cmath`
	- Then a flat +1, and a flat +33% original cost are added to this value, providing absolute floors to the cost reduction
	- The value is returned as INT, so some rounding will occur
	- For gameplay reasons, on-hit effects are further reduced to about 25% of the value generated this way. This is handled in the `int Enchanting::getEffectiveCastCost() const` function in the `enchanting.cpp` file, which applies a 0.25 multiplier to the base cost value before it goes into the above equation.
		- Interaction with `enchanting.cpp`

## 3.1a, Fixing the enchanted item on-use bug I introduced

`spellcasting.cpp`

 introduced a bug - the way I removed the "out of charge" message for on-hit effects resulted in it being removed from everything, but more than removing the message I appear to have removed the entire "stop" bit of the code - so as a result the game let's you cast enchanted items with 0 charge but they do nothing - however the entire animation plays, a bolt is generated, etc. So that's a problem that needs fixing, they need to register as out of charge still, go back and fix that

Current code in `spellcasting.cpp`
```
            if (item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() < castCost)
            {
                return false;
            }
```

original code (full block)

```
        if (!godmode && (type == ESM::Enchantment::WhenUsed || (!isProjectile && type == ESM::Enchantment::WhenStrikes)))
        {
            int castCost = getEffectiveEnchantmentCastCost(static_cast<float>(enchantment->mData.mCost), mCaster);

            if (item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() == -1)
                item.getCellRef().setEnchantmentCharge(static_cast<float>(enchantment->mData.mCharge));

            if (item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() < castCost)
            {
                if (mCaster == getPlayer())
                {
                    MWBase::Environment::get().getWindowManager()->messageBox("#{sMagicInsufficientCharge}");

                    // Failure sound
                    int school = 0;
                    if (!enchantment->mEffects.mList.empty())
                    {
                        short effectId = enchantment->mEffects.mList.front().mEffectID;
                        const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effectId);
                        school = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;
                    }

                    static const std::string schools[] = {
                        "alteration", "conjuration", "destruction", "illusion", "mysticism", "restoration"
                    };
                    MWBase::SoundManager *sndMgr = MWBase::Environment::get().getSoundManager();
                    sndMgr->playSound3D(mCaster, "Spell Failure " + schools[school], 1.0f, 1.0f);

                    /*
                        Start of tes3mp addition

                        Send an ID_OBJECT_SOUND packet every time a sound is made here
                    */
                    mwmp::ObjectList* objectList = mwmp::Main::get().getNetworking()->getObjectList();
                    objectList->reset();
                    objectList->packetOrigin = mwmp::CLIENT_GAMEPLAY;
                    objectList->addObjectSound(mCaster, "Spell Failure " + schools[school], 1.0f, 1.0f);
                    objectList->sendObjectSound();
                    /*
                        End of tes3mp addition
                    */
                }
                return false;
            }
            // Reduce charge
            item.getCellRef().setEnchantmentCharge(item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() - castCost);
        }
```

The fixed code block

```
        if (!godmode && (type == ESM::Enchantment::WhenUsed || (!isProjectile && type == ESM::Enchantment::WhenStrikes)))
        {
            int castCost = getEffectiveEnchantmentCastCost(static_cast<float>(enchantment->mData.mCost), mCaster);

            if (item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() == -1)
                item.getCellRef().setEnchantmentCharge(static_cast<float>(enchantment->mData.mCharge));

            if (item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() < castCost)
            {
                if (mCaster == getPlayer())
                {
                    if (type == ESM::Enchantment::WhenStrikes)
                    {
                        return false;
                    }
                    MWBase::Environment::get().getWindowManager()->messageBox("#{sMagicInsufficientCharge}");

                    // Failure sound
                    int school = 0;
                    if (!enchantment->mEffects.mList.empty())
                    {
                        short effectId = enchantment->mEffects.mList.front().mEffectID;
                        const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effectId);
                        school = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;
                    }

                    static const std::string schools[] = {
                        "alteration", "conjuration", "destruction", "illusion", "mysticism", "restoration"
                    };
                    MWBase::SoundManager *sndMgr = MWBase::Environment::get().getSoundManager();
                    sndMgr->playSound3D(mCaster, "Spell Failure " + schools[school], 1.0f, 1.0f);

                    /*
                        Start of tes3mp addition

                        Send an ID_OBJECT_SOUND packet every time a sound is made here
                    */
                    mwmp::ObjectList* objectList = mwmp::Main::get().getNetworking()->getObjectList();
                    objectList->reset();
                    objectList->packetOrigin = mwmp::CLIENT_GAMEPLAY;
                    objectList->addObjectSound(mCaster, "Spell Failure " + schools[school], 1.0f, 1.0f);
                    objectList->sendObjectSound();
                    /*
                        End of tes3mp addition
                    */
                }
                return false;
            }
            // Reduce charge
            item.getCellRef().setEnchantmentCharge(item.getCellRef().getEnchantmentCharge() - castCost);
        }
```

It already had the enchantment type data in the type variable, so I just asked it to early out and return if the type is on-strike (once it detects there is not enough charge)
The result is that behaviour is unchanged for on-use items, but for on-strike items the sound and error message no longer execute



## 3.2, XP gain
`npcstats.cpp`
- [ ] XP gain changes
- Changed the `useSkill` function to add a non-linear curve insertion of code block. Simply checks for players base skill level and reduces the XP gained by the multipliers shown in the mechanics changelog depending on level
- Also changed the `getSkillProgressRequirement` function in `npcstats.cpp` to have a floor value of 30, so skills below 30 will still require 30xp to advance. Done by adding a `std:: max 30` pre-check function to the existing calculation

## 3.3, Training costs
`trainingwindow.cpp`
- [ ] Training costs
- `trainingwindow.cpp` modified in two locations as in section 1.1 work area 2, using the values on google sheets, in such a way as to produce a non-linear increase in training costs for all skills whilst respecting the GMST. So the GMST setting of 10 can be doubled to 20, for example, and the non-linear price increases will also double uniformly.
- Note that two edits were required (with duplicate code) as this file calculates the cost mechanically and the cost in the UI (training window) independently

## 3.4, MR cap
`spellcasting.cpp`
`inventorystore.cpp`

 - [ ] Magic resistance now has no mechanical effect beyond 60% (after accounting for weakness effects which negate it 1:1)
 - Added a clause each to each of `spellcasting.cpp` and `inventorystore.cpp`. It was necessary for it to be formatted differently in each location, but the function is the same
 - Had to manually define the list of effects which were to have their resistances capped
	 - The reason was because I wanted not to cap the magnitude of resist magicka effects to avoid complicated changes to the UI and spell behaviour
 - TGM is unaffected, it still gets full immunity due to the location this code change was positioned
 - In `spellcasting.cpp` the `inflict` function was modified with a conditional check that caps magic resist for a pre-defined list of effects
 - In `inventorystore.cpp` the `updateMagicEffects` function was modified with the same logic but formatted slightly differently as this file required
 - The two changes were necessary as `inflict` in `spellcasting.cpp` covers all possible sources of negative effects except for constant effect enchantments, which are handled via the `inventorystore.cpp` code

## 3.5, Miscellaneous changes and fixes
`npcstats.cpp`
`repair.cpp`

- [ ] Skill books do not work at skill 95 and above anymore
- Added a single conditional clause that returns the function if the skill-up gain is from a book and the base skill is 95 or above. The relevant function is `increaseSkill` in `npcstats.cpp` under the `if (readBook)` check

- [ ] Reduced the armorer sounds by changing the `repair` function within `repair.cpp` to play the sound at 0.5 instead of 1.0. 
- This has to be done twice, as the tes3mp also sends a pakcet with the same information for others to hear. Also whilst the original values (from openmw) are written as "1.0" (which makes them doubles), I had to manually define them as floats when changing this otherwise a type conversion error was called. No effect on gameplay or code behaviour, just worth noting as an implicit conversion that has been made explicit
## 3.6, Melee changes
`npc.cpp`
`combat.cpp`

**Accuracy**
- [ ] The change to base hit chance calculations are implemented in the function `getHitChance` within `combat.cpp`. Something like (skill x 0.7) + 20, instead of (skill x1). Agility, luck, fatigue and enemy evasion are all handled normally
- [ ] 2h accuracy penalties are implemented in the same function `hit` within `npc.cpp`

**Damage**
- [ ] The change to how base damage is calculated (using skill as well as an attribute, with the same sum benefit of +50%) is implemented in the function `adjustWeaponDamage` within `combat.cpp`

**Weapon type benefits**
- [ ] Weapon type accuracy variations are implemented in `npc.cpp` within the function `hit`
- [ ] The changes to what contributes to damage for each weapon are implemented in the function `adjustWeaponDamage` within `combat.cpp`

## 3.7, Ranged changes
`combat.cpp`
**Accuracy**
- [ ] Ranged attacks follow the same accuracy change logic as implemented for melee, as determined in the `getHitChance` function within `combat.cpp`
	- In addition within the `projectileHit` function in `combat.cpp` ranged attacks are there given a flat +20 to hit, for balancing reasons (they are intended to be more accurate to make up for missed shots due to poor aim)

**Damage**
- [ ] Bows and crossbows have their damage modified to function similar to melee, increasing with skill and attribute, but they use agility as their damage attribute instead of strength. This is done in the `adjustWeaponDamage` function within `combat.cpp`
- [ ] Throwing scales differently, and uses strength and skill to determine damage. These are weighted equally as with melee, but the damage scaling for throwing progresses linearly from 0-100 to a higher cap of 200% weapon damage instead of 150% at 100 strength and 100 skill. Given that throwing weapons do 2x the stated damage, this means at max strength and skill throwing weapons do 4x the stated damage. This is also done in the `adjustWeaponDamage` function within `combat.cpp`

**Ammunition Recovery**
- [ ] Both enchanted and non-enchanted ammo recovery are handled via the `projectileHit` function within `combat.cpp` which has been modified
	- The function now checks player skill and uses it to multiply the GMST ammo recovery value. For non-enchanted the recovery rate cannot be less than 1x GMST, at from 25 to 100 it scales linearly up to 4x GMST (every 25 skill is another 1x GMST, it increments at each skill level as this is processed as a float)
	- The same function also allows for enchanted ammo recovery, but this only becomes possible at 50 skill and above. You start at 0 recovery rate at 50 skill, and each level beyond 50 adds 1/25th of the GMST recovery rate, so every 25 levels adds another 1x GMST up to 2x GMST total at 100 skill. This function hard caps the players skill it checks at 100 before processing, so there is no way to achieve beyond 2x GMST recovery rate.


## 3.8, Acrobatics and climbing
`movementsolver.hpp`
Headers added (to call base player skill)

The `static bool isWalkableSlope` logic within `movementsolver.hpp` was updated to check if it is the player (only the player is affected by this change), and to get the players base acrobatics skill and scale the climbing angle allowed based on skill as described in mechanics (2.8).

The climbing angle is hard capped at 89° to minimise the risk of unusual behaviour (this will all potentially interact with stepping upwards on stairs, and hitting steep surfaces when walking).

 - [ ] This change adjust the criteria for the engine to determine the boolean `iswalkableslope` and restricts it to the player
 - [ ] There is not effect on the default value (47°) at 30 skill or below, and no benefit beyond 92 base skill (the angle you can climb to is hard capped to 89° for compatibility reasons)
 - [ ] Increasing the angle to 90° (or beyond) does not allow true wall climbing, due to separate logic checks in the openmw engine that exist  to prevent wall collision/sticking
	 - [ ] I did not attempt to resolve this, as this would require a more extensive rework of the physics engine which would further risk compatibility with new content.
	 - [ ] In short, whilst wall climbing is technically possible with some changes it meant (in the version I trialled) that you "stuck" to every wall you touched, which meant your speed slowed down to a crawl as you attempted to being moving vertically up it at greatly reduced speed, which was a huge problem in many urban areas and most interiors
- [ ] The `sMaxSlope` variable is seemingly hard coded and not accessible to the compiler (47°) but it can be worked around in the way I have done without issues.
- [ ] There remain risks of floor detection failing when climbing, or clipping through ceilings, this will be investigated as playtesting continues.
- [ ] Several functions within `movementsolver.cpp` call the Boolean `iswalkableslope`, these have been checked for unintended knock-on effects, and of the functions within the `cpp` file there are only two are of potential concern (although no issues have been seen yet during playtesting)
	- `osg::Vec3f MovementSolver::traceDown` beginning on line 80, but the bool starts getting called around line 106
		- I have no idea what the ray tracing logic does here, but it seems only to be involved in whether you can walk or not on a slope (so probably the actual post-hoc function that is implementing this change)
		- But since it involves ray tracing and ground offset there could be some object detection/collision issues that result in clipping(?)
	- Also called twice between lines 367 to 392, to determine actor collision and determining if on slope. Again no idea what the impact of this is, but playtesting has not yet found an issue
	- Other areas of code checked and certainly of no concern for unintended behaviour, these two I couldn't pick apart in the time I spent on this (I am way out of my depth with the physics engine stuff)


## 3.9, Difficulty Tiers and new difficulty scaling
Modified files:
`difficultyscaling.hpp`
`difficultyscaling.cpp`
`spellcasting.cpp` - headers added

[Note that in addition to these changes, further functions were added in V0.70, see 3.25, hand to hand, which also affects the difficulty scaling files.]
### 3.9.1, Tier function
In `difficultyscaling.hpp`
- `int difficultyTier();` function defined

In `difficultyscaling.cpp`:
- The function `int difficultyTier()` has been added 
	- This gets the difficulty and converts it to a tier
	- It gets the server config file difficulty setting (or player specific if overridden by server admins in tes3mp, the player specific values have not been play tested - as with base tes3mp it is not looking at the openmw difficulty setting)

The actual server config to difficulty tier conversion table as shown below:

| Server value | Tier | Comments                          | Tier name   |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Less than 0  | 1    | 1 = normal, unchanged, difficulty | Apprentice  |
| 1-50         | 2    |                                   | Journeyman  |
| 51-100       | 3    |                                   | Master      |
| 101-150      | 4    |                                   | Grandmaster |
| 151-200      | 5    |                                   | Agent       |
| 201+         | 6    | 6 = absurdly difficult            | Nerevarine  |


```
int difficultyTier()
{
    /// openmw difficulty check, code preserved as I dont know what effects removing it could have
    int difficultySetting = Settings::Manager::getInt("difficulty", "Game");
    difficultySetting = std::min(difficultySetting, 500);
    difficultySetting = std::max(difficultySetting, -500);


    /// difficulty is got from the local player info as per tes3mp change versus openmw and this overrides the openmw setting
    difficultySetting = mwmp::Main::get().getLocalPlayer()->difficulty;
    difficultySetting = std::min(difficultySetting, 500);
    difficultySetting = std::max(difficultySetting, -500);

    if (difficultySetting <= 0)
        return 1;
    else if (difficultySetting <= 50)
        return 2;
    else if (difficultySetting <= 100)
        return 3;
    else if (difficultySetting <= 150)
        return 4;
    else if (difficultySetting <= 200)
        return 5;
    else
        return 6;
}
```

### 3.9.2, Moving melee damage to tiers

In `difficultyscaling.cpp`:
The `float scaledamage` function has been updated to use the difficulty tier values as input for damage scaling, and now outputs pre-defined discrete damage modifiers at each tier as shown in this section. The effect of difficulty on melee damage dealt/taken now no longer operates via an equation which inputs `x` as difficulty.
Originally I think this was an int? In any case the original function has been completely overwritten.

- Note that this reduction in melee damage applies (as it does in the base game) after enemy armour is considered, so you will still be checking and overcoming armour using the same base game logic (for now, armour intentionally not touched at this stage of development as it's quite complicated and may not need adjusting at all)

Melee damage dealt/taken by difficulty tier:

| Difficulty setting | Tier | % Melee Dealt | % Melee Taken |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Less than 0        | 1    | 100           | 100           |
| 1-50               | 2    | 75            | 150           |
| 51-100             | 3    | 50            | 200           |
| 101-150            | 4    | 30            | 300           |
| 151-200            | 5    | 20            | 400           |
| 201+               | 6    | 15            | 500           |

The `scaledamage` function just uses a `switch` logic table to choose the modifier based on tier got by `difficultyTier()`, as shown below:
```
float scaleDamage(float damage, const MWWorld::Ptr& attacker, const MWWorld::Ptr& victim)
{
    const MWWorld::Ptr& player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();

    int tier = difficultyTier();

    float dealMult = 1.0f;
    float takeMult = 1.0f;

    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        dealMult = 0.75f;   
        takeMult = 1.50f;  
        break;
    case 3:
        dealMult = 0.50f;  
        takeMult = 2.00f;   
        break;
    case 4:
        dealMult = 0.30f; 
        takeMult = 3.00f;  
        break;
    case 5:
        dealMult = 0.20f;  
        takeMult = 4.00f;  
        break;
    case 6:
        dealMult = 0.15f;  
        takeMult = 5.00f; 
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }

    if (attacker == player)
    {
        damage *= dealMult;
    }
    else if (victim == player)
    {
        damage *= takeMult;
    }

    return damage;
}
```


### 3.9.3, Scaling on-strike and adding enchantment type detection

Via the following changes, on-strike enchantments specifically are tied to their own damage scaling table, which also operates off of difficulty tier - for now it is identical to melee damage dealt, but it is coded separately for ease of balancing

Tested and working for all effects, all sources of effect and also confirmed that absorb health correctly halves the magnitude of damage done and haling received (it should do automatically, and it did, just checking)

| Difficulty setting | Tier | % Melee Dealt | % Melee Taken | % Enchantment damage dealt |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Less than 0        | 1    | 100           | 100           | 100                        |
| 1-50               | 2    | 75            | 150           | 75                         |
| 51-100             | 3    | 50            | 200           | 50                         |
| 101-150            | 4    | 30            | 300           | 30                         |
| 151-200            | 5    | 20            | 400           | 20                         |
| 201+               | 6    | 15            | 500           | 15                         |

Within `difficultyscaling.cpp`
`float onstrikeDamageScale()` function added, which simply gets tier and via a switch table returns a float modifier which is applied to spell effect magnitude. Unlike melee damage, for ease of implementation and changes, this does not take the damage and modify/return it, instead it locally only generates the multiplier, and spell magnitude is adjusted in situ for on-strike enchantments

Within `difficultyscaling.hpp`
defined that function via `float onstrikeDamageScale();`

```
float onstrikeDamageScale()
{
    int tier = difficultyTier();
    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1: return 1.00f;
    case 2: return 0.75f;
    case 3: return 0.50f;
    case 4: return 0.30f;
    case 5: return 0.20f;
    case 6: return 0.15f;
    default: return 1.0f;
    }
}
```

However for this to work I had to enable the inflict portion of the `spellcasting.cpp` functions to get enchantment type (so I could filter there by enchantment type)

`spellcasting.cpp` headers update to include difficulty scaling via
`#include "difficultyscaling.hpp"`

The final block inserted within the `inflict` function in `spellcasting.cpp` - 
```
                if (mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::WhenStrikes && target != player && caster == player && (effectholder == 14 || effectholder == 15 || effectholder == 16 || effectholder == 18 || effectholder == 23 || effectholder == 27 || effectholder == 86))
                {
                    magnitude *= onstrikeDamageScale();
                }
```


[Base function without enchantment type]
First of all `!spell` checks the spell effect being inflicted is not in the players spell book (note that the `inflict` function processes all spell damaging effects)
`target != player` checks that the target is not the player (since this function is going to scale down damage, and we want to keep monster damage dealt the same)
`mCaster == player` checks the originator of the effect is the player, `mCaster` is already available in the base game, as it being handed to the generic `castspell` which is being overloaded into inflict
`effectholder` is defined just above this block via
`int effectholder = effectIt->mEffectID;`
and gets the spell effect enumeration as int, so that this function can be restricted to the manually curated list of effects only - I do not think this information (spell effect ID) was originally available in the function, but earlier coding changes to enchanting involved me making that information available locally, so no extra changes were needed by this stage, but see enchanting changes for how spell effect ID was made locally available within `spellcasting.cpp`

All of that (still excluding the `mEnchantmentType` check logic for now) would restrict the damage being dealt to when:
- It is a spell
- 'Cast' by the player
- That is not in the players spell book
- Whose target is anyone who is not the player
- Who effect is on the pre-defined list (each effect has it's magnitude checked, modified and applied separately, as per the base game functions in `spellcasting.cpp`)

[Adding enchantment type part 1 - header file + overload function]
That might be enough, but the only check so far (prior to me adding `mEnchantmentype`) to see that this was an on-strike was to check it was not a spell the player new, which probably was never going to work (scrolls may have been caught in this, as may have just about any other misc effects I wasn't expecting)

So then I wanted to give the function access to the type of enchantment which was the source of the effect, this was more complex as it involved tracing back the functions...

By default there is no enchantment information passed to this function.

`mEnchantmentType` was added to the generic `CastSpell::CastSpell` function so it could be overloaded whilst holding that data (set to a placeholder of -1, so that it wouldn't accidently trigger)
- Note that `mEnchantmentType` is stored and passed as an int, but can be (and is in my code) written as the string name of that enchantment type for readability

```
namespace MWMechanics
{
    CastSpell::CastSpell(const MWWorld::Ptr &caster, const MWWorld::Ptr &target, const bool fromProjectile, const bool manualSpell)
        : mCaster(caster)
        , mTarget(target)
        , mEnchantmentType(-1)
        , mSourceType(SourceType::Spell)
        , mFromProjectile(fromProjectile)
        , mManualSpell(manualSpell)
    {
    }
```

I'm pretty sure I added it here in the `spellcasting.hpp` header file, might have already been there, if not you need to add the line `struct Enchantment;`
```
namespace ESM
{
    struct Spell;
    struct Ingredient;
    struct Potion;
    struct EffectList;
    struct Enchantment;
}
```

Within `spellcasting.hpp`, within the `class castspell` space, the line
	- `int mEnchantmentType;` 
was added, so that the `castspell` function had that value initialised

```
    private:
        MWWorld::Ptr mCaster; // May be empty
        MWWorld::Ptr mTarget; // May be empty

        /// dwemer coda gets the enchantment type
        int mEnchantmentType;
```


[Adding enchantment type part 2 - sub-function within spellcasting.cpp]

Within `bool CastSpell::cast(const MWWorld::Ptr &item, bool launchProjectile)`,
which is the item specific function (the one that handles spells being cast from items, including those that apply on-strike),
The line
`        mEnchantmentType = enchantment->mData.mType;`
was added, which gets the enchantment type using the values initialised into the header file

I'm gonna be honest, at this point in the documentation I notice that the
 `bool CastSpell::cast(const MWWorld::Ptr &item, bool launchProjectile)`
 function already has all this data for decision like when to grant XP, so some or all my pre-steps in the header file may not have been necessary, oh well, I'm going to assume they are and just leave my steps in

Anyway, lastly because of all the above the `inflict` function now automatically has access to the `mEnchantmentType` data, as it passed to it from the `item` function automatically, so now in the `inflict` function I can then add the conditional check of,
`&& mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::WhenStrikes`,
in the if statement

This truly restricts these changes to spell effects coming from on-strike enchantments, so no unintended behaviour

The complete list of effects (for now) that will scale by difficulty are:
Destruction:
[14] Fire damage
[15] Shock damage
[16] Frost damage
[18] Drain health
[23] Damage health
[27] Poison
[86] Absorb health

[Going back and cleaning the function a little]

The function was trimmed a little to remove the `!spell` check, since it has become redundant since adding the enchantment type check, and actually I want this still to scale damage even if it is somehow in your spell book

So now it reads

```
if (mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::WhenStrikes && target != player && mCaster == player && (effectholder == 14 || effectholder == 15 || effectholder == 16 || effectholder == 18 || effectholder == 23 || effectholder == 27 || effectholder == 86))
 {
    magnitude *= onstrikeDamageScale();
 }
```


### 3.9.4, Castonce enchantment damage scaling

I scaled down the damage less aggressively than with melee, as unlike melee you can run out of mana/charge when casting, so it is a more premium resource

| Difficulty Tier | % Enchantment magic damage dealt |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1               | 1x                               |
| 2               | 0.85x                            |
| 3               | 0.7x                             |
| 4               | 0.5x                             |
| 5               | 0.33x                            |
| 6               | 0.25x                            |

Code changes,
`difficultyscaling.hpp` updated to include new function,
`float castenchantedDamagescale();`,
that function added to `difficultyscaling.cpp` and does,

```
float castenchantedDamagescale()
{
    int tier = difficultyTier();
    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1: return 1.00f;
    case 2: return 0.85f;
    case 3: return 0.70f;
    case 4: return 0.50f;
    case 5: return 0.33f;
    case 6: return 0.25f;
    default: return 1.0f;
    }
}
```

then in `spellcasting.cpp`, a duplicate of the if statement used for on-strike damage modification was added with two changes, 1. it checks for on-use, 2. it applies `castenchantedDamagescale` instead

```
if ((mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::CastOnce || mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::WhenUsed) && target != player && caster == player && (effectholder == 14 || effectholder == 15 || effectholder == 16 || effectholder == 18 || effectholder == 23 || effectholder == 27 || effectholder == 86))
{
    magnitude *= castenchantedDamagescale();
}
```

### 3.9.5, On-use enchantment damage scaling

Done via updating the start of the above function in 4.2, to allow for either `castonce` or `whenused`. No other changes needed, working, they both use the same damage scaling function as a result (intended)

```
if ((mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::CastOnce || mEnchantmentType == ESM::Enchantment::WhenUsed)
```

### 3.9.6, Spell damage dealt

One change was left unfinished as it is not yet required, but will be:
- The actual scaling function that processes the spell magnitude in `difficultyscaling.cpp` is the same one that does enchanted items, etc, as for now I decided the scaling for each could match, but in the next revision it would be better to separate them so that they can be scaled separately 

**Summary**
`spellcasting.hpp`
[1] `spellcasting.hpp` updated with new `enum class SourceType`, for use in tracking spell effect source/origin
[2] `spellcasting.hpp` also updated to initialise `SourceType` via the line
`SourceType mSourceType{ SourceType::None };` 
which was inserted at the bottom of the public space starting with
`bool mStack{false};`
[3] at some point in the `spellcasting.hpp` file I think I changed the order things are declared in that same public namespace, from what was default, I remember this was not necessary - in the end I can't see that I kept this change, but just keep it in mind in case there is an apparent different in line order in my version compared to the original, it was for this reason if so
`spellcasting.cpp`
[4] See the working out section below, it became a little involved and whilst it is all documented i need to summarise it for this section

**Working out**
Originally I just wanted to do something like
```
if ( spell && castByPlayer )
{
    // difficulty modifier goes here
}

```

The spellcasting.hpp header file had a new enumeration added to it for this purpose as below

```
    public:
        enum class SourceType
        {
            None,
            Spell,
            Potion,
            Ingredient,
            EnchantedItem
        };
```

this went right after 

```
    class CastSpell
    {

```

before the first private namespace

In addition to that, I also had to initialise the value in the `public:` space as shown below
```
    public:
        bool mStack{false};
        std::string mId; // ID of spell, potion, item etc
        std::string mSourceName; // Display name for spell, potion, etc
        osg::Vec3f mHitPosition{0,0,0}; // Used for spawning area orb
        bool mAlwaysSucceed{false}; // Always succeed spells casted by NPCs/creatures regardless of their chance (default: false)
        bool mFromProjectile; // True if spell is cast by enchantment of some projectile (arrow, bolt or thrown weapon)
        bool mManualSpell; // True if spell is casted from script and ignores some checks (mana level, success chance, etc.)
        SourceType mSourceType{ SourceType::None }; // dwemercoda addition
```
so just the last line was added


With all that done it was then used in `spellcasting.cpp` in the following way,
The `CastSpell::CastSpell` overload was updated to include the line
`, mSourceType(SourceType::Spell)`

```
{
    CastSpell::CastSpell(const MWWorld::Ptr &caster, const MWWorld::Ptr &target, const bool fromProjectile, const bool manualSpell)
        : mCaster(caster)
        , mTarget(target)
        , mEnchantmentType(-1)
        , mSourceType(SourceType::Spell)
        , mFromProjectile(fromProjectile)
        , mManualSpell(manualSpell)
    {
```


**Working out for the spellcasting.cpp file as opposed to the header**
Within `spellcasting.cpp`,
I updated the basic ` CastSpell::CastSpell` function to include the line
`, mSourceType(SourceType::Spell)` as shown below

```
{
    CastSpell::CastSpell(const MWWorld::Ptr &caster, const MWWorld::Ptr &target, const bool fromProjectile, const bool manualSpell)
        : mCaster(caster)
        , mTarget(target)
        , mEnchantmentType(-1)
        , mSourceType(SourceType::Spell)
        , mFromProjectile(fromProjectile)
        , mManualSpell(manualSpell)
    {
```

so that it would be a part of the overload to other functions

So this by default sets the source to spell (necessary as discussed later),

The overload  then passes to
`bool CastSpell::cast(const std::string &id)`
which sorts the spell effect into one of three functions, there were no changes here, just tracking it so the documentation is readable

Then within,
`bool CastSpell::cast(const ESM::Potion* potion)`
I added,
`mSourceType = SourceType::Potion;`,
as the first line

This means that the source type is flagged as potion when the overload passes to the potion function handler

The same was done for,
`bool CastSpell::cast (const ESM::Ingredient* ingredient)`, via
`mSourceType = SourceType::Ingredient;`
and
`bool CastSpell::cast(const ESM::Spell* spell)`, via
`mSourceType = SourceType::Spell;`

In addition for enchanted items handled via,
`bool CastSpell::cast(const MWWorld::Ptr &item, bool launchProjectile)`, I added,
`mSourceType = SourceType::EnchantedItem;`
but for this one it came after

```
        {
            const std::string &refId = item.getCellRef().getRefId();
            auto &store = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore();
            if (auto spell = store.get<ESM::Spell>().search(refId))
                return cast(spell);
        }
```

which I also had to add for bug fixing reasons (due to how spells are actually handled),

so the start of, `bool CastSpell::cast(const MWWorld::Ptr &item, bool launchProjectile)`,
now reads:

```
    bool CastSpell::cast(const MWWorld::Ptr &item, bool launchProjectile)
    {

        {
            const std::string &refId = item.getCellRef().getRefId();
            auto &store = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore();
            if (auto spell = store.get<ESM::Spell>().search(refId))
                return cast(spell);
        }

        mSourceType = SourceType::EnchantedItem;

        std::string enchantmentName = item.getClass().getEnchantment(item);
        (continues base code here...)
```

So with all of that set up, the following occurs,

The basic
`CastSpell::CastSpell(const MWWorld::Ptr &caster, const MWWorld::Ptr &target, const bool fromProjectile, const bool manualSpell)`
begins and sets source type to spell,
then,
`bool CastSpell::cast(const std::string &id)`,
passes to either the potion, ingredient, spell or item & ptr function, where at each it is correctly assigned that source type via my line additions,
(and some bug fixes detailed below),
then the data for source type is automatically made accessible in the inflict function and be used to filter spells by source

**The bug fixes**
Two issues with the above,
1. `bool CastSpell::cast(const MWWorld::Ptr &item, bool launchProjectile)` actually handles both items and spells saved in the game BSA/ESP files (so ever spell you can learn which you do not make yourself), so they would otherwise bypass the cast as a spell function and be left with the enchanted item tag

This was fixed by adding the clause I detailed above,

```
        {
            const std::string &refId = item.getCellRef().getRefId();
            auto &store = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore();
            if (auto spell = store.get<ESM::Spell>().search(refId))
                return cast(spell);
        }
```

Which tries to check if the spell being passed to this function is in your spell book, and if so tries to pass to the spell cast as "spell", I can't remember if this became obsolete with the next change but I left it in as I have confirmed no unintended behaviour

Since the route of a spell being cast that was already in the BSA/ESM (and hence not being handled typically by the `spell` casting) somehow things were getting through with  no spell flag assigned at all

This was only an issue at first due to the fact that originally I had declared,
`, mSourceType(SourceType::None)`,
at the top in,
`CastSpell::CastSpell(const MWWorld::Ptr &caster, const MWWorld::Ptr &target, const bool fromProjectile, const bool manualSpell)`

so to fix that I had to update that line to:
`, mSourceType(SourceType::Spell)`

so that it defaults them to go through spell, and the other filters take everything out of that stream and put them into their proper functions

**Testing and confirmation**
- Potions and ingredients are not being affected (even when they allowed into the function implicitly by updating it to capture player casting on themselves), in other words the source type of spell check is correctly filtering them out
- With the updated logic for testing, spells cast on self were affected as intended
- Both custom and base game potions were tested
- All other spell sources were manually re-tested and confirmed working, for each of these items, both player made (custom) and pre-existing (base game) variants were tested and confirmed to follow the logic as intended (no unintended behaviour)
	- On-use items, on-strike effects, scrolls (aka cast once), and actual spells (including powers)

The original issue I found, and had to correct by defaulting the source type to spell rather than none, was that pre-made spells bought from vendors had a chance (unclear if all or just some did) to be passed straight to inflict via the ptr & item function, so they escaped the flag of spell as the source type, and were not being stepped down

### 3.9.7, Magic damage taken

This is a magic damage amplifier for damage taken by the player (restricted to certain, damaging, effects) that excludes non actor sources of magic (such as traps and scripted effects). It also excludes self targeted effects by the player

In `spellcasting.cpp`, within the `inflict` function,

```
if (target == player && mCaster != player && !caster.isEmpty() && !reflected && caster.getClass().isActor() && (effectholder == 14 || effectholder == 15 || effectholder == 16 || effectholder == 18 || effectholder == 23 || effectholder == 27 || effectholder == 86))
{
    magnitude *= magicdamagetaken();
}
```

the above conditional logic was added, which is linked to the `magicdamagetaken` function in `difficultyscaling.c/hpp`

In `difficultyscaling.cpp`

```
float magicdamagetaken()
{
    int tier = difficultyTier();
    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1: return 1.00f;
    case 2: return 1.25f;
    case 3: return 1.50f;
    case 4: return 2.00f;
    case 5: return 2.50f;
    case 6: return 3.00f;
    default: return 1.0f;
    }
}
```

and in `difficultyscaling.hpp`

```
float magicdamagetaken();
```

**Explanation of above changes**

The `spellcasting.cpp` has a lot of guarding on, to be certain that spell magnitude is only being amplified under specific circumstances:

`if (target == player && mCaster != player` - ensures only the player is affected, and only when the player is not the source of the effect
`&& !caster.isEmpty()` and `&& caster.getClass().isActor() ` - is how non actor sources are filtered out, unless there is an actual entity that cast the spell it won't be modified, so this excludes (confirmed via testing) traps and scripted effects. This was added for traps, but also to proof this clause as strongly as I can against modded content where scripted effects are being used as effect sources (which they rarely are if at all in the base game)
`&& !reflected ` - for the reflect logic, covered in the section below
`&& (effectholder == 14 || effectholder == 15 || effectholder == 16 || effectholder == 18 || effectholder == 23 || effectholder == 27 || effectholder == 86))` - restricts it just to directly damaging effects: fire, frost, shock, poison, absorb health, damage health, drain health

Between the `&& !caster.isEmpty()` and `&& caster.getClass().isActor()` I think the former is now redundant - in testing it did not filter traps (didn't test it with scrips) as even an object springing a trap counted as being a caster, the latter is more watertight and may function on it's own, as it requires the caster is an actor (which excludes objects and the world, only NPCs and creatures fit this category)

Testing confirmed:
- All player self cast "spells" (potions, ingredients, enchantments) are unaffected
- Monsters casting spells on the player are affected
- Traps are not affected
- Constant effect items are not affected
- Damage reflected at you via the reflect effect is not amplified (See the reflect section below)

### 3.9.8, Accounting for reflected damage

By default all of the changes so far did not account for reflected effects (although some of the code above this may have been documented after reflect corrections were made to it).

The consequence of this in game-play was that:
- Magic effects being reflected onto monsters were not being properly stepped down by tier, and were applying at a flat 1x damage. This would have allowed by-passing the difficulty tier magic damage stepdown if left unchanged
- The player was also taking a flat 1x damage regardless of difficulty tier

I decided not to fix the second point (damage reflected onto the player), and the first point was fixed with the below changes...

**Damage reflected onto the player**
I did not fix this on purpose for balance reasons, but it could be in the same way as the inverse problem was fixed below.

The reasoning was that already in the base game, getting a spell reflected onto you is potentially lethal if you are not prepared for it - spellcasters will typically have lower health (if they are not min-maxing their attributes as they level), and are less likely to pick high endurance starts if they are roleplaying.

That and the base game has an unusual health scaling curve (which I may be going to fix later) which in effect means that until mid to high levels, and especially without good endurance, the player has much less health than monsters and relies more on healing, armour and positioning - which is great until you cast a 50 point shock spell and it's reflected onto your 80 health pool at level 10 (if you had 40 endurance from level 1 to 10). 
In other words the base game requires player spell damage output be disproportionally high compared to their own health pools due to the health it gives to monsters beyond the early game.

So for those reasons I intentionally did not correct player damage taken for now, for balance reasons, and it remains a flat 1x when reflected regardless of difficulty tier.

The reason it behaves this way is because of this bit of the if logic for player magic damage taken...

```
target == player && mCaster != player
```

It checks the target is the player (which it is when reflected) and the `mCaster` (essentially the original caster for the purpose of the current, base, overload implementation) is not the player - however in the case of a monster reflection, the `mCaster` is still the player (although the game does update the `caster` variable, which is tracked separately, to the monster as the new local `caster` within the overload loop)

**Damage reflected on monsters**
This I did fix, as without these fixes it allowed the player to cheese all high difficulty settings but just reflecting monster spells back to them at 1x damage (for the same if statement logic reasons as above), by-passing the intended player magic damage done step-down of up to x0.15

The monster magic damage taken was checking (via the three separate functions that track spells, on-hit spells, and on-use together with cast-once sources),
`&& target != player && mCaster == player`
So it checks the target is not the player via `target != player` (which is fine),
but it was also originally checking,
`mCaster == player`,
so it was also requiring the original source of the spell effect to be the player, hence it was implicitly excluding all monster originating effects that were being reflected onto monsters - thus escaping out out of the effect magnitude reduction that should otherwise have applied

the fix was to change it to
`target != player && caster == player`
so that instead it looks for effects locally originating from the player, regardless of the original source, and so now it includes all reflected effects and properly steps them down on high difficulties


## 3.9a Elemental shield damage scaling bug

Elemental shield was, up until V0.40, still operating off of the base game damage scaling function, and so was being scaled as if it were melee damage.

This was changed to bring it in line with all other spell effect difficulty scaling

Original code
```
            // Note swapped victim and attacker, since the attacker takes the damage here.
            x = scaleDamage(x, victim, attacker);
```

Replaced with
```
            MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();

            if (attacker == player)
            {
                x *= magicdamagetaken();
            }

            if (attacker != player)
            {
                x *= castenchantedDamagescale();
            }

```


## 3.10, Equipment derived armour ratings

`armor.cpp`

Within `armor.cpp`,

The base game function `getEffectiveArmorRating` (shown below in full),

```
    float Armor::getEffectiveArmorRating(const MWWorld::ConstPtr &ptr, const MWWorld::Ptr &actor) const
    {
        const MWWorld::LiveCellRef<ESM::Armor> *ref = ptr.get<ESM::Armor>();

        int armorSkillType = getEquipmentSkill(ptr);
        float armorSkill = actor.getClass().getSkill(actor, armorSkillType);

        const MWBase::World *world = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld();
        int iBaseArmorSkill = world->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("iBaseArmorSkill")->mValue.getInteger();

        if(ref->mBase->mData.mWeight == 0)
            return ref->mBase->mData.mArmor;
        else
            return ref->mBase->mData.mArmor * armorSkill / static_cast<float>(iBaseArmorSkill);
    }
```

was modified to say...

```
    float Armor::getEffectiveArmorRating(const MWWorld::ConstPtr &ptr, const MWWorld::Ptr &actor) const
    {
        const MWWorld::LiveCellRef<ESM::Armor> *ref = ptr.get<ESM::Armor>();

        MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();

        int armorSkillType = getEquipmentSkill(ptr);
        float armorSkill = actor.getClass().getSkill(actor, armorSkillType);

        const MWBase::World *world = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld();
        int iBaseArmorSkill = world->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("iBaseArmorSkill")->mValue.getInteger();

        if(ref->mBase->mData.mWeight == 0)
            return ref->mBase->mData.mArmor;

        if (actor == player && armorSkill < 30.0f)
            {
                return (ref->mBase->mData.mArmor * (armorSkill + 5) / (static_cast<float>(iBaseArmorSkill) + 5));
            }

        else
            return ref->mBase->mData.mArmor * armorSkill / static_cast<float>(iBaseArmorSkill);
    }
```

The change was to add the line
`MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();` to get the player ID,
and to add the if statement logic

```
        if (actor == player && armorSkill < 30.0f)
            {
                return (ref->mBase->mData.mArmor * (armorSkill + 5) / (static_cast<float>(iBaseArmorSkill) + 5));
            }
```

so that only in cases were armour is being calculated for the player, and their skill is below 30, the modified equation of (skill + 5) / (GMST + 5) is used


## 3.11, Unarmoured derived armour ratings
`npc.cpp`

Within `npc.cpp` the function `getArmorRating` calculates player armour rating locally

The function has a fork in it's logic for if the armour class is being calculated for the player. The below logic fork was inserted into the original function, immediately after it calculates the unarmoured score normally via `ratings[i] = (fUnarmoredBase1 * unarmoredSkill) * (fUnarmoredBase2 * unarmoredSkill);.`

It was done this way so that for all entities the engine still generates an original armour score, and then the if pointer is player fork simply overwrites that score with the new one.

I could also have done a true fork to split the old and new equations, but I structured it in this way (to be overwritten) purely for code testing purposes and have not reverted it. It doesn't matter either way, the effect is the same, that the following code block is what calculates the player's unarmoured score.

The result is:
For skill levels below 30, `AC = Skill/3`
For skill levels 30 to 70,`AC = 10 + ( (Skill - 30) * 1.625 )`
For skill levels above 70`AC = 75 + ( (Skill - 70) * 2.5 )`

                        statmultiplier += agilityholder;
                    }

                    playerunarmoured *= statmultiplier;
	                
	                /// this x10 mod goes in just so that the GMST holds

                    playerunarmoured *= fUnarmoredBase1;

                    ratings[i] = playerunarmoured;
                }
            }
```


## 3.12, Creature armour ratings

`creature.cpp`

(within `creature.cpp`) By default within this file the following logic is used for creature armour ratings

```
    float Creature::getArmorRating (const MWWorld::Ptr& ptr) const
    {
        // Equipment armor rating is deliberately ignored.
        return getCreatureStats(ptr).getMagicEffects().get(ESM::MagicEffect::Shield).getMagnitude();
    }
```

Now it reads

```
    float Creature::getArmorRating (const MWWorld::Ptr& ptr) const
    {
        // Equipment armor rating is deliberately ignored.

        float creaturearmour = 0.0f;
        creaturearmour += 10.0f;
        creaturearmour += getCreatureStats(ptr).getMagicEffects().get(ESM::MagicEffect::Shield).getMagnitude();

        int creaturelevel = getCreatureStats(ptr).getLevel();

        if (creaturelevel >= 5)
        {
            creaturearmour += 2.0f;
        }

        if (creaturelevel >= 10)
        {
            creaturearmour += 3.0f;
        }

        return creaturearmour;
    }
```

The effect is creature armour rating is now 10AC at a minimum for everything, the full logic is now

10 + shield + level boost (which is +2 at level 5+, and +5 at level 10+)

## 3.13, Armorer

### 3.13.1, Equipment degradation rates
Changes made to
`npc.cpp`
`combat.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.hpp`
#### 3.13.1.1, Shields
Shields taking damage is governed in `combat.cpp` beginning at line 165

They take damage equal to the damage dealt by the creature (before difficulty and before armour applies, so the base damage in the engine for that creature)

The order of operations within `npc.cpp` that results in the call to `BlockMeleeattack` within `combat.cpp` is,
- Line 778, where the `BlockMeleeattack` function is called
- Line 942, where armour mitigation applies
- Line 1002, where difficulty scaling applies

So this means each hit on a shield will reduce it's durability by the un-mitigated damage done by the attacker. So a 5 damage hit will take exactly 5 off a shield.

The original code governing item health reduction was

```
// Reduce shield durability by incoming damage
int shieldhealth = shield->getClass().getItemHealth(*shield);
shieldhealth -= std::min(shieldhealth, int(damage));
shield->getCellRef().setCharge(shieldhealth);
if (shieldhealth == 0)
    inv.unequipItem(*shield, blocker);
```

and it was changed to this

```
// Reduce shield durability by incoming damage
int shieldhealth = shield->getClass().getItemHealth(*shield);

int damagetoshieldmodded = damage;

MWWorld::Ptr player = getPlayer();

if (blocker == getPlayer())
{
    float armorerSkill = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Armorer);
    armorerSkill = std::min(100.0f, armorerSkill);
    armorerSkill = std::max(1.0f, armorerSkill);

    float armorerx = 1.0f - (armorerSkill * 0.0075f);
    
    damagetoshieldmodded *= armourdamagetaken();
    /// new function, covered elsewhere in documentation

    damagetoshieldmodded = static_cast<int>(damagetoshieldmodded * armorerx);
    damagetoshieldmodded = std::max(1, damagetoshieldmodded);
}

shieldhealth -= std::min(shieldhealth, int(damagetoshieldmodded));
shield->getCellRef().setCharge(shieldhealth);
if (shieldhealth == 0)
    inv.unequipItem(*shield, blocker);

```

The changes are that,
- The damage is snapshotted as `damagetoshieldmodded` and if the blocker is not the applier, that is what is subtracted from the shield health at the end (so there is no change for non-player characters)
- Then for the player only...
- Get your armorer skill (modified) but clamp it to 1-100
- Multiply the amount of damage the shield was supposed to take by `1 - (skill * 0.0075`
	- This has the effect that at 100 armorer skill (the max that can be passed to this calculation) your shield takes 0.25x health damage
	- The final damage taken is raised to 1 if the multiplier reduces it to any less


#### 3.13.1.2, Armour
`npc.cpp`

The function changed was the following block of code, within `void Npc::onHit(const MWWorld::Ptr &ptr, float damage, bool ishealth, const MWWorld::Ptr &object, const MWWorld::Ptr &attacker, const osg::Vec3f &hitPosition, bool successful)` within `npc.cpp`

As with all other changes, it is player only

It just scales down the amount of armour damage taken exactly as it does for shields, -0.75% per skill level with a hard cap of -75% at skill 100


```
                if (hasArmor)
                {
                    if (!object.isEmpty() || attacker.isEmpty() || attacker.getClass().isNpc()) // Unarmed creature attacks don't affect armor condition
                    {
                        int armorhealth = armor.getClass().getItemHealth(armor);

                        int Diffholder = damageDiff;

                        if (ptr == MWMechanics::getPlayer())
                        {
                            MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();
                            float armorerSkill = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Armorer);
                            armorerSkill = std::min(100.0f, armorerSkill);
                            armorerSkill = std::max(1.0f, armorerSkill);

                            float armorerx = 1.0f - (armorerSkill * 0.0075f);
                            
                            Diffholder *= armourdamagetaken(); 
                            /// new function, covered elsewhere in documentation

                            Diffholder = static_cast<int>(Diffholder * armorerx);
                            Diffholder = std::max(1, Diffholder);

                        }

                        armorhealth -= std::min(Diffholder, armorhealth);
                        armor.getCellRef().setCharge(armorhealth);

                        // Armor broken? unequip it
                        if (armorhealth == 0)
                            armor = *inv.unequipItem(armor, ptr);
                    }
```

#### 3.13.1.3, Weapons
`combat.cpp`
function `reduceWeaponCondition`

Identical degradation reduction logic implemented as for armour and shields, 100-25%

```
    void reduceWeaponCondition(float damage, bool hit, MWWorld::Ptr &weapon, const MWWorld::Ptr &attacker)
    {
        if (weapon.isEmpty())
            return;

        if (!hit)
            damage = 0.f;

        const bool weaphashealth = weapon.getClass().hasItemHealth(weapon);
        if(weaphashealth)
        {
            int weaphealth = weapon.getClass().getItemHealth(weapon);

            bool godmode = attacker == MWMechanics::getPlayer() && MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getGodModeState();

            // weapon condition does not degrade when godmode is on
            if (!godmode)
            {
                const float fWeaponDamageMult = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fWeaponDamageMult")->mValue.getFloat();
                float x = std::max(1.f, fWeaponDamageMult * damage);

                MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();
                if (attacker == player)
                {
                    /// get and clamp armorer skill
                    float armorerSkill = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Armorer);
                    armorerSkill = std::min(100.0f, armorerSkill);
                    armorerSkill = std::max(1.0f, armorerSkill);

                    float armorerx = 1.0f - (armorerSkill * 0.0075f);

                    x = (armorerx * x);
                    
	                x *= weapondamagetaken();

                    x = std::max(1.0f, x);

                }

                weaphealth -= std::min(int(x), weaphealth);
                weapon.getCellRef().setCharge(weaphealth);
            }

            // Weapon broken? unequip it
            if (weaphealth == 0)
                weapon = *attacker.getClass().getInventoryStore(attacker).unequipItem(weapon, attacker);
        }
    }
```

#### 3.13.1.4, Accounting for difficulty
`difficultyscaling.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.hpp`

Since I have previously overhauled the difficulty slider so that player damage dealt can drop as low as 15%, and damage taken (melee) as high as 500%, there is a knock-on effect on item degradation.

The order of operations is that the difficulty setting modifies the melee damage taken/dealt after all item health reductions are processed. On the face of it this means there is no effect, but it in fact introduces two types of unusual behaviour
- Now when you are on high difficulties, and dealing 15% melee damage, your weapon is still degrading as if you had dealt 100% damage (due to the order of operations, with all item health being processed before the difficulty tier steps down the melee damage done)
	- This means that relative to your melee damage done, your weapon ends up taking up to 7 times more durability damage, as it calculated all 7 of those 15% hits as 100% hits
- And the same issue applies in reverse to your armour, where the armour has it's health reduced by the damage mitigated, which is still 1x regardless of difficulty due to the order of operations, and then the player takes up to 5x damage
	- So your armour is taking damage as if you were on normal difficulty, but you are taking 5x damage, meaning you are probably getting hit about 5x less if you aren't past the power threshold. So your armour will on average degrade about 5 times slower

To address this I added some new functions in `difficultyscaling.cpp` which are used to adjust weapon/armour damage taken dependent on difficulty tier.
I decided to do it this way so as to preserve as much of the original order of operations as possible.

Function 1: modifying armour damage taken
```
float armourdamagetaken()
{
    int tier = difficultyTier();
    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1: return 1.00f;
    case 2: return 1.50f;
    case 3: return 2.00f;
    case 4: return 3.00f;
    case 5: return 4.50f;
    case 6: return 5.00f;
    default: return 1.0f;
    }
}
```

Function 2: modifying weapon damage taken
```
float weapondamagetaken()
{
    int tier = difficultyTier();
    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1: return 1.00f;
    case 2: return 0.75f;
    case 3: return 0.50f;
    case 4: return 0.30f;
    case 5: return 0.20f;
    case 6: return 0.15f;
    default: return 1.0f;
    }
}
```

These two registered in `difficultyscaling.hpp` via

```
float armourdamagetaken();

float weapondamagetaken();
```


These were then inserted into the already modified degradation rate equations as such,

```
	if (ptr == MWMechanics::getPlayer())
	{
	    MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();
	    float armorerSkill = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Armorer);
	    armorerSkill = std::min(100.0f, armorerSkill);
	    armorerSkill = std::max(1.0f, armorerSkill);
	
	    float armorerx = 1.0f - (armorerSkill * 0.0075f);
	
		Diffholder *= armourdamagetaken();
	
	    Diffholder = static_cast<int>(Diffholder * armorerx);
	    Diffholder = std::max(1, Diffholder);
	
	}

armorhealth -= std::min(Diffholder, armorhealth);
armor.getCellRef().setCharge(armorhealth);
```

for shields,

```
            if (blocker == getPlayer())
            {
                float armorerSkill = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Armorer);
                armorerSkill = std::min(100.0f, armorerSkill);
                armorerSkill = std::max(1.0f, armorerSkill);

                float armorerx = 1.0f - (armorerSkill * 0.0075f);

                damagetoshieldmodded *= armourdamagetaken();

                damagetoshieldmodded = static_cast<int>(damagetoshieldmodded * armorerx);
                damagetoshieldmodded = std::max(1, damagetoshieldmodded);
            }
```

and for weapons,

```
            if (attacker == player)
            {
                /// get and clamp armorer skill
                float armorerSkill = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Armorer);
                armorerSkill = std::min(100.0f, armorerSkill);
                armorerSkill = std::max(1.0f, armorerSkill);

                float armorerx = 1.0f - (armorerSkill * 0.0075f);

                x *= weapondamagetaken();

                x = (armorerx * x);

                x = std::max(1.0f, x);

```


### 3.13.2, Your armorer repair success rate now depends on item value
Header additions to `repair.cpp` and `merchantrepair.cpp`
`repair.cpp`
`merchantrepair.cpp`
#### 3.13.2.1, General changes
The following header addition was added to both `repair.cpp` and `merchantrepair.cpp`
`#include "../mwworld/inventorystore.hpp"`

This was required to allow these functions to do checks based on equipment slots, which take this form

```
    auto slotPair = itemToRepair.getClass().getEquipmentSlots(itemToRepair);
    const std::vector<int> &slots = slotPair.first;

    if (!slots.empty())
    {
        if (slots[0] == static_cast<int>(MWWorld::InventoryStore::Slot_Helmet))
        {
            x = 0;
        }
    }
```

This is how price/difficulty behaviour differs between weapons and armour, by checking the lot they are in

Weapons are separated from armour using a block like this

```
    if (!slots.empty())
    {
        if (slots[0] == static_cast<int>(MWWorld::InventoryStore::Slot_CarriedRight))
        {
            x = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            x = 100;
        }
    }
```


#### 3.13.2.2, Assigning item tiers
To make balancing and implementation easier, items have been broken up (within this code block) into 'tiers' which are determined by their price. So that an item in tier 5 can have one difficulty at skill 50, and an item in tier 7 can be much harder at the same skill.

Within `repair.cpp` the 'item price -> tier' logic results in the following tiers by equipment type

| ARMOUR          |          | (includes shields)                                                |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value range** | **Tier** | **Sample items in tier**                                          |
| 100g or less    | 1        | All basic light armour + the weakest heavy + medium armour        |
| 101 - 499g      | 2        | All common heavy + medium armour                                  |
| 500-1999g       | 3        | Rare medium and some heavy                                        |
| 2000-4999g      | 4        | Rare TR light + rare medium                                       |
| 5000-19,999g    | 5        | Glass, Ebony, Adamantium                                          |
| 20,000 - 49,999 | 6        | Daedric, Mithril, Ebony, Glass                                    |
| 50,000 +        | 7        | Artefacts + Daedric                                               |
|                 |          |                                                                   |
| **WEAPONS**     |          |                                                                   |
| **Value range** | **Tier** | **Sample items in tier**                                          |
| 100g or less    | 1        | Iron up to dwarven, some 2h and some magic items                  |
| 101 - 499g      | 1        | most common material weapons, magic items                         |
| 500-1999g       | 2        | strong magical items, some end-game base materials (orc)          |
| 2000-4999g      | 3.5      | combined T3+T4 difficulty, uniques, cheap ebony, most common weps |
| 5000-19,999g    | 5        | Glass, Ebony, Adamantium, Uniques, Artefacts                      |
| 20,000 - 49,999 | 6        | Daedric, Artefacts, Uniques                                       |
| 50,000 +        | 7        | Artefacts + Daedric                                               |

The tier assigning logic is

```
    int tier = 1;

    if (basePrice <= 100)
    {
        tier = 1;
    }
    if (basePrice > 100)
    {
        tier = 2;
    }
    if (basePrice >= 500)
    {
        tier = 3;
    }
    if (basePrice >= 2000)
    {
        tier = 4;
    }
    if (basePrice >= 5000)
    {
        tier = 5;
    }
    if (basePrice >= 20000)
    {
        tier = 6;
    }
    if (basePrice >= 50000)
    {
        tier = 7;
    }
```

Followed by this block, which processes weapons into lower tiers for balance reasons

```
    if (!slots.empty())
    {
        if (slots[0] == static_cast<int>(MWWorld::InventoryStore::Slot_CarriedRight))
        {

            /// step down of difficulty for all early and mig-game weapons, to help keep skill non-essential
            if (tier == 2)
            {
                tier = 1;
            }
            if (tier == 3)
            {
                tier = 2;
            }
            if (tier == 4)
            {
                tier = 3;
            }
        }
    }
```

To be honest, this was a very messy way to do it, and the entire concept of a tier 3.5 ended up being pretty much pointless. This needs a future clean-up, where I just adjust the initial tier assignment logic for weapons.

#### 3.13.2.3, Success rate equations
`repair.cpp`
The original code simply did
`float x = (0.1f * pcStrength + 0.1f * pcLuck + armorerSkill) * fatigueTerm;`

This section covers how this was changed to a tiered system, where each tier of item has it's own difficulty calculated.

First of all, since the later changes here involved calculating their new difficulties using curved line equations, I put a hard cap on x via some clamping. This was done to avoid any unusual math behaviour when otherwise very large x values are squared (because it's morrowind, getting 10,000 strength is not hard).

That clamping was just

```
    float basepercent = (0.1f * pcStrength + 0.1f * pcLuck + armorerSkill) * fatigueTerm;

    if (basepercent > 500.0f)
    {
        basepercent = 500.0f;
    }
```

note that x has become `basepercent`, which will be modified in the new equations

The idea was to get a value for x that was somewhat simplified, and then to feed it into curved line equations to produce something like sinusoidal difficulty curves.

To simplify what x is a little, the `fatigueTerm` was modified slightly, via the block
```
    /// adjust down fatigue term as part of this balance pass
    fatigueTerm -= 0.25f;


    /// calculate base percent
    float basepercent = (0.1f * pcStrength + 0.1f * pcLuck + armorerSkill) * fatigueTerm;
```

The idea is that now at full fatigue the `fatigueTerm` has a 1x modifier, and drops down to a 0.5x when you have no fatigue remaining
This was done because there is no reason you would not wait to get fatigue back if repairing, since you cannot do it in combat, so it seemed pointless adding a 1.25x modifier to the whole skill in practise - and having the 1.25x modifier complicated how x is calculated from skill and attributes for testing purposes

The individual difficulty modifiers by tier take the form shown below, note that all of the tiers have a floor success %. 

```
    float basepercent = (0.1f * pcStrength + 0.1f * pcLuck + armorerSkill) * fatigueTerm;


    if (tier == 1)
    {
        x = ((0.0136f * basepercent * basepercent) + (0.59f * basepercent) - 6.75f);
        if (x < 20.0f)
        {
            x = 20.0f;
        }
    }
```

There is one per tier, and the equations which govern them are,

```
    if (tier == 1)
    {
        x = ((0.0136f * basepercent * basepercent) + (0.59f * basepercent) - 6.75f);
        if (x < 20.0f)
        {
            x = 20.0f;
        }
    }

    if (tier == 2)
    {
        x = ((0.0128f * basepercent * basepercent) + (0.399f * basepercent) - 4.89f);
        if (x < 17.0f)
        {
            x = 17.0f;
        }
    }

    if (tier == 3)
    {
        if (slots[0] == static_cast<int>(MWWorld::InventoryStore::Slot_CarriedRight))
        {
            /// the tier 3.5 version, whcih is slightly harder than 3 but still easier than the 4 weapons would otherwise be
            x = ((0.0051f * basepercent * basepercent) + (1.121f * basepercent) - 39.15f);
            if (x < 14.0f)
            {
                x = 14.0f;
            }
        }

        else
        {
            x = ((0.0033f * basepercent * basepercent) + (1.342f * basepercent) - 30.0f);
            if (x < 15.0f)
            {
                x = 15.0f;
            }
        }
    }

    if (tier == 4)
    {
        x = ((0.0035f * basepercent * basepercent) + (1.21f * basepercent) - 36.34f);
        if (x < 10.0f)
        {
            x = 10.0f;
        }
    }

    if (tier == 5)
    {
        x = ((0.0114f * basepercent * basepercent) + (0.23f * basepercent) - 27.64f);
        if (x < 7.0f)
        {
            x = 7.0f;
        }
    }

    if (tier == 6)
    {
        x = ((0.0072f * basepercent * basepercent) + (0.51f * basepercent) - 41.4f);
        if (x < 5.0f)
        {
            x = 5.0f;
        }
    }

    if (tier == 7)
    {
        x = ((0.014f * basepercent * basepercent) - (0.552f * basepercent) - 14.63f);
        if (x < 5.0f)
        {
            x = 5.0f;
        }
    }
```

### 3.13.3, Armorer's tools now modify success rate
`repair.cpp`
This was done within `repair.cpp` as well, modifying the same block as was done above.

See the code block below, the relevant bit is the tool quality adjustment logic. I have shown the surrounding code to show the order of operations.

```

    /// adjust down fatigue term as part of this balance pass
    fatigueTerm -= 0.25f;


    /// calculate base percent
    float basepercent = (0.1f * pcStrength + 0.1f * pcLuck + armorerSkill) * fatigueTerm;


    /// new tool quality adjustments

    if (toolQuality > 1.0f)
    {
        float qualitymod = (toolQuality - 1.0f);
        qualitymod *= 10.0f;
        qualitymod *= 1.50f;
        basepercent += qualitymod;
    }


    /// a hard cap, some guarding to avoid silly numbers appearing in nonlinear squaring equations
    /// this does impose an arbitrarily high but final cap on success rate, as values of x beyond 100 do help

    if (basepercent > 500.0f)
    {
        basepercent = 500.0f;
    }


    if (tier == 1)
    {
        x = ((0.0136f * basepercent * basepercent) + (0.59f * basepercent) - 6.75f);
        if (x < 20.0f)
        {
            x = 20.0f;
        }
    }
```



### 3.13.4, Armour repair costs
`merchantrepair.cpp`
The core repair code now reads

```
        if (iter->getClass().hasItemHealth(*iter))
        {
            int maxDurability = iter->getClass().getItemMaxHealth(*iter);
            int durability = iter->getClass().getItemHealth(*iter);
            if (maxDurability == durability || maxDurability == 0)
                continue;

            int basePrice = iter->getClass().getValue(*iter);
            float fRepairMult = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>()
                    .find("fRepairMult")->mValue.getFloat();

            float p = static_cast<float>(std::max(1, basePrice));
            float r = static_cast<float>(maxDurability / p);

            int x = static_cast<int>((maxDurability - durability) / r);
            x = static_cast<int>(fRepairMult * x * 0.5f);
            x = std::max(1, x);

            int price = MWBase::Environment::get().getMechanicsManager()->getBarterOffer(mActor, x, true);
```

The difference from the original code is that r is no longer set to 1 via `std::max`

Since the line for r was originally

```
float r = static_cast<float>(std::max(1, static_cast<int>(maxDurability / p)));
```

The effect was that r would never be less than 1, due to the `std::max` operation, and only r values less than 1 increase the price past 1gp per item health, since the cost is later calculated as health restored / r.

This preserves the base game functionality of item's costing less than 1gp per item health to repair,

By making this change, items now cost a % of their value equal to the % of their health being restored.

In addition the line
`x = static_cast<int>(fRepairMult * x * 0.5f);`
had the 0.5f multiplier added, so that final cost to repair an item fully is 50% of the item's full value

This was done to make the prices more reasonable for testing, and for the first version, but the player can adjust `fRepairMult` at an ESP level, so further in game changes can be made on the fly, to taste.



## 3.14, Athletics derived swim speed
`npc.cpp`

This change boosts the contribution to swim speed (as a % of base run speed) by the player's athletics from 1% a level to 3% a level. Resulting in the player going from 50-80% swim speed, vs 50-60% in the base game, when they go from 1-100 athletics.

This is restricted to the player only via an if player is ptr check, and replacing a hardcoded value with a local variable in the function.

There is a hard cap to how much athletics can contribute to swim speed of level 500 athletics (which works out to +150% run to swim speed, on top of the 50% you get at skill 1. For a total of 200% base swim speed at 500 skill).

The function `getSwimSpeed`,

```
    float Npc::getSwimSpeed(const MWWorld::Ptr& ptr) const
    {
        const GMST& gmst = getGmst();
        const MWBase::World* world = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld();
        const MWMechanics::CreatureStats& stats = getCreatureStats(ptr);
        const NpcCustomData* npcdata = static_cast<const NpcCustomData*>(ptr.getRefData().getCustomData());
        const MWMechanics::MagicEffects& mageffects = npcdata->mNpcStats.getMagicEffects();
        const bool swimming = world->isSwimming(ptr);
        const bool inair = !world->isOnGround(ptr) && !swimming && !world->isFlying(ptr);
        const bool running = stats.getStance(MWMechanics::CreatureStats::Stance_Run)
                && (inair || MWBase::Environment::get().getMechanicsManager()->isRunning(ptr));

        float swimSpeed;

        if (running)
            swimSpeed = getRunSpeed(ptr);
        else
            swimSpeed = getWalkSpeed(ptr);

        swimSpeed *= 1.0f + 0.01f * mageffects.get(ESM::MagicEffect::SwiftSwim).getMagnitude();
        swimSpeed *= gmst.fSwimRunBase->mValue.getFloat()
                + 0.01f * getSkill(ptr, ESM::Skill::Athletics) * gmst.fSwimRunAthleticsMult->mValue.getFloat();

        return swimSpeed;
    }
```

was updated as follows

```
    float Npc::getSwimSpeed(const MWWorld::Ptr& ptr) const
    {
        const GMST& gmst = getGmst();
        const MWBase::World* world = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld();
        const MWMechanics::CreatureStats& stats = getCreatureStats(ptr);
        const NpcCustomData* npcdata = static_cast<const NpcCustomData*>(ptr.getRefData().getCustomData());
        const MWMechanics::MagicEffects& mageffects = npcdata->mNpcStats.getMagicEffects();
        const bool swimming = world->isSwimming(ptr);
        const bool inair = !world->isOnGround(ptr) && !swimming && !world->isFlying(ptr);
        const bool running = stats.getStance(MWMechanics::CreatureStats::Stance_Run)
                && (inair || MWBase::Environment::get().getMechanicsManager()->isRunning(ptr));

        float swimSpeed;

        if (running)
            swimSpeed = getRunSpeed(ptr);
        else
            swimSpeed = getWalkSpeed(ptr);

        MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();

        float athleticsswimmod = 0.01f;

        float athleticsholder = getSkill(ptr, ESM::Skill::Athletics);

        if (ptr == player)
        {
            athleticsswimmod = 0.03f;
            if (athleticsholder > 500.0f)
            {
                athleticsholder = 500.0f;
            }
        }

        swimSpeed *= 1.0f + 0.01f * mageffects.get(ESM::MagicEffect::SwiftSwim).getMagnitude();
        swimSpeed *= gmst.fSwimRunBase->mValue.getFloat()
                + athleticsswimmod * athleticsholder * gmst.fSwimRunAthleticsMult->mValue.getFloat();

        return swimSpeed;
    }
```

This change
- Respects all GMSTs
- Caps skill contribution to swimming only
- Toggles variable value for player and non-players (which are preserved with base game behaviour)

## 3.16, Mercantile
`mechanicsmanagerimp.cpp`
`tradewindow.cpp`
`trading.cpp`

To facilitate the changes listed in 2.16.2, the following changes were made at an engine level

### 3.16.2.1, Mercantile disposition has reduced effect on bartering
`mechanicsmanagerimp.cpp`

In the base game every points of disposition above or below 50 adds or removes 1 mercantile skill. This means that by bribing an NPC up to 100 disposition you effectively gain 50 mercantile skill, which reduces the value of levelling the actual skill quite a lot.

Disposition is processed via `getDerivedDisposition`. Exactly what it does is not relevant here, but that function is where things like disease, whether the player is holding a weapon, and faction bonuses, apply to your disposition.

Disposition has been reduced in importance by adjusting the base game function to include

```
float dispositionmodified = ((clampedDisposition - 50) * 0.25f);
float pcTerm = (dispositionmodified + a + b + c) * playerStats.getFatigueTerm();
```

whereas before it said

```
float pcTerm = (clampedDisposition - 50 + a + b + c) * playerStats.getFatigueTerm();
```

The result is that now every 4 points of disposition above or below 50 adds or removes 1 effective mercantile skill, and the highest effective boost you can get at 100 disposition is + 12.5 mercantile levels.


### 3.16.2.2, Mercantile disposition has reduced effect on haggling

Not actually a compiling level change, but listed here as it complements the engine level change made above. At an ESP level the GMST `fDispositionMod` governs the extent to which disposition affects haggling, it is 1.0 by default and was adjusted to 0.25 so that 4 points of disposition above or below 50 add or remove 1 effective mercantile level. Now as with bartering, the maximum benefit you can get from 100 disposition is +12.5 effective mercantile levels.


### 3.16.2.3, Adjustments to min and max buy/sell rates
`tradewindow.cpp`

To fix a loophole where with sufficient mercantile and haggling (quite easy to reach actually in the old system due to disposition) you could make infinite money buying and reselling items, the buying/selling rate caps were adjusted, and floors were put in as well.

In the base engine both buying and selling have a cap of 75%, which in theory is breaking even but allows haggling to exceed this limit trivially.

So to fix this,
in `tradewindow.cpp`, within the function `void TradeWindow::updateOffer()`,
the clamps on max buy and sell prices have been set to 90% and 60% respectively, so now you can never 'break even' when re-buying (which is necessary to allow room for haggling to be useful, without exceeding the break even ratio of 1:1 buy/sell)

In addition, within the same function in this file

- I added a floor to the maximum value you can be charged for something (150%)
- I added a floor to the minimum value you can sell something for (20%)

These two additions mean that no matter your skill, and no matter the merchant, you can still functionally trade with them (this is to guard against the removal of disposition boosts being available, as you are far more likely now to actually run into situations where you struggle to sell things for any reasonable price, if you rely on charming over your mercantile skill)

Note: these are local changes to item selling and buying, since this change is hosted within `tradewindow.cpp`, as a result all other service charges remain uncapped and be reduced much more than to 90%, if you have a high enough mercantile skill

### 3.16.2.4, Setting a hard limit on haggling of 10%
`trading.cpp`

To go with the change above which hard caps the barter rates, a hard limit has been placed on haggling rates (although this is not an ideal solution, and is likely to be revised in future versions).

Within `trading.cpp`, within the `bool Trading::haggle` function,

this clause has been added to it

```
        float ratio = std::abs(float(playerOffer)) / std::abs(float(merchantOffer));
        if (ratio < 0.9f || ratio > 1.1f)
        {
            x = 0.0f;
        }
```

This gets the ratio between what the player wants and what the merchant wants. If the amount exceeds 110% or is below 90%, then it sets x to 0 (you cannot succeed). 

This way you can still haggle past this point for one off purchases, but you cannot sell or buy anything that has been haggled past 10% of the original offer value. Combined with the previous buy cap of 90% (in the buy rate fix above) and the sell cap of 60%, this means at the absolute best you can haggle to a 80% buy and 70% sell rate, which prevents breaking even and circulating items infinitely for free XP (in the new XP gain system, covered below).

This is a very aggressive and crude fix, and will likely be replaced with something more nuanced in a later version, but for now it serves it's purpose without introduces any bugs.

### 3.16.2.5, XP gain overhaul

#### Generic XP gain functions

The generic XP gain function is

```
    void Npc::skillUsageSucceeded (const MWWorld::Ptr& ptr, int skill, int usageType, float extraFactor) const
    {
        MWMechanics::NpcStats& stats = getNpcStats (ptr);

        if (stats.isWerewolf())
            return;

        MWWorld::LiveCellRef<ESM::NPC> *ref = ptr.get<ESM::NPC>();

        const ESM::Class *class_ =
            MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::Class>().find (
                ref->mBase->mClass
            );

        stats.useSkill (skill, *class_, usageType, extraFactor);
    }
```

and it calls out to `useSkill` in `npcstats.cpp`

I have already modified this function previously to implement the XP curve, but you can see it begins with

```
void MWMechanics::NpcStats::useSkill (int skillIndex, const ESM::Class& class_, int usageType, float extraFactor)
{
    const ESM::Skill *skill =
        MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::Skill>().find (skillIndex);
    float skillGain = 1;
    float base = getSkill(skillIndex).getBase();
    if (usageType>=4)
        throw std::runtime_error ("skill usage type out of range");
    if (usageType>=0)
    {
        skillGain = skill->mData.mUseValue[usageType];
        if (skillGain<0)
            throw std::runtime_error ("invalid skill gain factor");
    }
    skillGain *= extraFactor;

```

So that the `extraFactor` which can optionally be passed at the point of skill gain acts as a multiplier to the final value.

So an `extraFactor` of exactly 1.0 means you gain the stated XP in the creation it ESP file, values above or below 1 multiply the XP up or down accordingly. Having an `extraFactor` is optional, you can call the function without it, and in that case it defaults to 1

#### Remove haggling based XP gain
`trading.cpp`

In `trading.cpp`, within the `haggle` function, the following code block was removed completely, so that you no longer gain XP from haggling

```
        // apply skill gain on successful barter
        float skillGain = 0.f;
        int finalPrice = std::abs(playerOffer);
        int initialMerchantOffer = std::abs(merchantOffer);

        if ( !buying && (finalPrice > initialMerchantOffer) ) {
            skillGain = floor(100.f * (finalPrice - initialMerchantOffer) / finalPrice);
        }
        else if ( buying && (finalPrice < initialMerchantOffer) ) {
            skillGain = floor(100.f * (initialMerchantOffer - finalPrice) / initialMerchantOffer);
        }
        player.getClass().skillUsageSucceeded(player, ESM::Skill::Mercantile, 0, skillGain);
```

#### Full new XP gain system
`tradewindow.cpp`

Experience gain from haggling has been removed, now XP is gained from the value of items sold.

Within `tradewindow.cpp` the `onOfferButtonClicked` function was updated extensively.

**The final function additions are:**
[1] Snapshot the amount of gold being transferred, if it is positive (meaning if it is towards the player). This is used in part [2]. This addition was done right before the sub-function tagged with `// transfer the gold`.

[1] snapshot of gold being transferred
```
        ///snapshot the gold you recieve, if any, for DC XP calculations further down
        int goldRecieved = 0;
        if (mCurrentBalance > 0)
        {
            goldRecieved = mCurrentBalance;
        }
```

[2] The main XP assigning function

```
        /// DC system for calcualting XP gained from sales

        int sumBaseSold = 0;
        int sumBasePurchased = 0;

        if (!merchantBought.empty())
        {
            ///sum the base gold value of all items you are selling
            for (const ItemStack& stack : merchantBought)
            {
                MWWorld::Ptr objectPtr = stack.mBase;
                int singleValue = objectPtr.getClass().getValue(objectPtr);

                for (int i = 0; i < stack.mCount; ++i)
                {
                    if (singleValue > 0)
                    {
                        sumBaseSold += singleValue;
                    }
                }
            }

            ///sum the base gold value of all items you are recieving
            if (!playerBought.empty())
            {
                for (const ItemStack& stack : playerBought)
                {
                    MWWorld::Ptr objectPtr = stack.mBase;
                    int singleValue = objectPtr.getClass().getValue(objectPtr);

                    for (int i = 0; i < stack.mCount; ++i)
                    {
                        if (singleValue > 0)
                        {
                            sumBasePurchased += singleValue;
                        }
                    }
                }

            }

        }

        MWWorld::Ptr playerPtr = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getPlayerPtr();

        /// calculate the barter value of everything you sold
        const int barterItemsSold = MWBase::Environment::get().getMechanicsManager()->getBarterOffer(playerPtr, sumBaseSold, false);

        ///calculate the barter value of everything you purchased
        const int barterItemsPurchased = MWBase::Environment::get().getMechanicsManager()->getBarterOffer(playerPtr, sumBasePurchased, true);

        ///sum the gold you recieved and the barter value of the items you recieved
        int totalValuePurchased = (barterItemsPurchased + goldRecieved);

        ///cap the total value of what you have gained to be no more than the barter value of what you sold
        totalValuePurchased = std::min(barterItemsSold, totalValuePurchased);

        ///calculate the ratio of what your items were worth in this transaction to what you got
        float xpMultiplier = 1.0f;
        if (barterItemsSold > 0)
        {
            xpMultiplier = ((float)totalValuePurchased / (float)barterItemsSold);
        }

        /// use the barter value of items sold to determine XP gain
        float xpAwardIncrements = 0.0f;
        if (barterItemsSold > 0)
        {
            xpAwardIncrements = (float(barterItemsSold) / 50.0f);
        }

        ///apply the multiplier for potentially underselling items
        xpAwardIncrements *= xpMultiplier;

        ///award experience if items were sold for a non zero value
        if (barterItemsSold > 0)
        {
            if (xpAwardIncrements > 0.0f)
            {
                player.getClass().skillUsageSucceeded(player, ESM::Skill::Mercantile, 0, xpAwardIncrements);
            }
        }


        /// end of DC xp gain system
```

How this works,
1. Snapshot the total value of gold being exchanged, and save it if it is a positive amount (which means in the engine that it is an amount being transferred to the player from an NPC)
2. If the player is selling something, get the sum base value of all items being sold
3. If in the same transaction the player is buying something (so a partial exchange for gold and items), get the sum base value of all items being received
4. Calculate the 'barter value' of all items being sold (the initial value they are offered at via the `getbarteroffer` function)
5. Calculate the 'barter value' of all items being bought in the same transaction (the initial value they are offered at via the `getbarteroffer` function)
6. Calculate the sum value of everything you received, in gold and barter value of items, but cap that sum value at no more than the barter value of what you sold.
	1. This cap is needed otherwise you can sell an item for 100g, buy 10,000g worth of items, and without this cap end up getting XP for 'selling' 10,000g worth of items
7. Calculate the ratio of the barter value of your items sold, to the value of what you got from the transaction (using the cap set in step 6)
8. Calculate the amount of XP you will be awarded, in increments of 0.3xp, based on the amount of barter value you sold. In the version for V0.50 this is 50gp per 0.3xp, or about 166.7gp per XP
9. Apply a potential step down multiplier to that XP amount used the ratio calculated in step 7. This means that if you intentionally undersell items to get rid of them, you will get proportionally less XP (as that is not something that a good merchant would do!)
10. Award XP, using the value calculated in step 9 as the extra factor

The end result is that
- You get XP based on the value of items you sell
- You get less XP if you intentionally undersell
- Items received in kind are accounted for, and count towards you receiving full payment
- Buying things intentionally does not give XP


## 3.17, NPC spellcasting locked to base game spell effect costs

`spellutil.cpp`
`spellutil.hpp`
`autocalcspell.cpp`
`autocalcspell.hpp`
`spellpriority.cpp`

An exhaustive search was done in the engine for all direct and indirect references to spell effect costs made by NPCs. Three areas were found and adjusted so that NPCs used new hard-coded base game spell effect cost values.

### 3.17.1, Locking `calcSpellBaseSuccessChance()`
`spellutil.cpp`

The function `calcSpellBaseSuccessChance()` iterates over the weakest school of magic in a spell that the player or an NPC is casting to determine which spell school is the least effective at casting a multi-school spell. It does by using live ESP values for spell effect costs, whereas actual spell cost is locked at the point of spell creation.

Original function

```
    float calcSpellBaseSuccessChance (const ESM::Spell* spell, const MWWorld::Ptr& actor, int* effectiveSchool)
    {
        // Morrowind for some reason uses a formula slightly different from magicka cost calculation
        float y = std::numeric_limits<float>::max();
        float lowestSkill = 0;

        for (const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect : spell->mEffects.mList)
        {
            float x = static_cast<float>(effect.mDuration);
            const auto magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);

            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::AppliedOnce))
                x = std::max(1.f, x);

            x *= 0.1f * magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            x *= 0.5f * (effect.mMagnMin + effect.mMagnMax);
            x += effect.mArea * 0.05f * magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            if (effect.mRange == ESM::RT_Target)
                x *= 1.5f;
            static const float fEffectCostMult = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>().find(
                        "fEffectCostMult")->mValue.getFloat();
            x *= fEffectCostMult;

            float s = 2.0f * actor.getClass().getSkill(actor, spellSchoolToSkill(magicEffect->mData.mSchool));
            if (s - x < y)
            {
                y = s - x;
                if (effectiveSchool)
                    *effectiveSchool = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;
                lowestSkill = s;
            }
        }

        CreatureStats& stats = actor.getClass().getCreatureStats(actor);

        float actorWillpower = stats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Willpower).getModified();
        float actorLuck = stats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Luck).getModified();

        float castChance = (lowestSkill - spell->mData.mCost + 0.2f * actorWillpower + 0.1f * actorLuck);

        return castChance;
    }
```

Updated function

```
    float calcSpellBaseSuccessChance (const ESM::Spell* spell, const MWWorld::Ptr& actor, int* effectiveSchool)
    {
        // Morrowind for some reason uses a formula slightly different from magicka cost calculation
        float y = std::numeric_limits<float>::max();
        float lowestSkill = 0;
        MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();

        for (const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect : spell->mEffects.mList)
        {
            float x = static_cast<float>(effect.mDuration);
            const auto magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);

            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::AppliedOnce))
                x = std::max(1.f, x);

            float effectCost = 1.0f;

            if (actor != player)
            {
                // NPC logic forks into the getBaseGameEffectCost function which manually defines all base game effect values
                effectCost = getBaseGameEffectCost(effect.mEffectID);
            }
            else
            {
                effectCost = magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            }
            
            x *= 0.1f * effectCost;
            x *= 0.5f * (effect.mMagnMin + effect.mMagnMax);
            x += effect.mArea * 0.05f * effectCost;
            if (effect.mRange == ESM::RT_Target)
                x *= 1.5f;
            static const float fEffectCostMult = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>().find(
                        "fEffectCostMult")->mValue.getFloat();
            x *= fEffectCostMult;

            float s = 2.0f * actor.getClass().getSkill(actor, spellSchoolToSkill(magicEffect->mData.mSchool));
            if (s - x < y)
            {
                y = s - x;
                if (effectiveSchool)
                    *effectiveSchool = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;
                lowestSkill = s;
            }
        }

        CreatureStats& stats = actor.getClass().getCreatureStats(actor);

        float actorWillpower = stats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Willpower).getModified();
        float actorLuck = stats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Luck).getModified();

        float castChance = (lowestSkill - spell->mData.mCost + 0.2f * actorWillpower + 0.1f * actorLuck);

        return castChance;
    }
```

Changes
- The new function checks if it is running for the player or not for the player. For the player only now, it gets the ESP spell effect costs.
- For non players, it now calls out to the new function (discussed below) `getBaseGameEffectCost`

This only affects NPC spell selection priority, via their casting chances, and this change now means that NPCs operate independently of ESP level magic effect changes. This has the consequence that NPCs are now only compatible with base game magic effect costs, **so any modded content that changes ESP level magic effect costs, give those spells to NPCs and expects them to cast them will have balance issues.**
- This is an intentional design choice, as it is the easiest solution to fix this issue and to ensure full TR compatibility.

### 3.17.2, New hardcoded function, `getBaseGameEffectCost`
`spellutil.cpp`
`spellutil.hpp`

To facilitate the changes above, and the ones below in this section, a simple switch function was made for all base game spell effects.

This was added to `spellutil.cpp`, and the header file `spellutil.hpp` was updated with this line to initialise it,
`float getBaseGameEffectCost(int effectID);`

In `spellutil.cpp` the function was added as follows (this is an abbreviated version, the full function lists every spell effect with it's corresponding base game value)

```
    float getBaseGameEffectCost(int effectID)
    {
        switch (effectID)
        {
        case ESM::MagicEffect::WaterBreathing:           return 3.0f;
        case ESM::MagicEffect::SwiftSwim:                return 2.0f;
        case ESM::MagicEffect::WaterWalking:             return 3.0f;
        case ESM::MagicEffect::Shield:                   return 2.0f;
        case ESM::MagicEffect::FireShield:               return 3.0f;
        case ESM::MagicEffect::LightningShield:          return 3.0f;
        ... etc... [omitted for brevity]
        
        default:
            return 1.0f;
        }
    }
```

- It is a simple switch function
- If it fails to return anything (which should never happen, but to stop crashing just in case) it defaults to an effect cost of 1.0f


### 3.17.3, Locking `calcWeakestSchool()`
`autocalcspell.cpp`
`autocalcspell.hpp`

This is the most complicated change in this section. Since `calcWeakestSchool()` does not carry actor information, and for various reasons it would be not suitable to add it, instead I have added a Boolean flag to the surrounding functions to distinguish calls made by the player and calls made by NPCs.

Firstly the function `calcWeakestSchool()` was modified to carry a Boolean `useNpcCost` which is set to false by default.

The header file `autocalcspell.hpp` was updated so that `calcWeakestSchool()` is now defined like this,

```
void calcWeakestSchool(const ESM::Spell* spell, const int* actorSkills, int& effectiveSchool, float& skillTerm, bool useNpcCost = false);
```

and `autocalcspell.cpp` was updated to reflect that as follows

```
    void calcWeakestSchool (const ESM::Spell* spell, const int* actorSkills, int& effectiveSchool, float& skillTerm, bool useNpcCost)
    {
    ... [rest of function goes here]
```

Within `calcWeakestSchool()` there is a new logic fork which checks

```
            if (useNpcCost == false)
            {
                // Player behaviour, use live ESP mBaseCost values
                effectCost = magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            }
            else
            {
                // NPC fork, use hardcoded base game values as per this function
                effectCost = getBaseGameEffectCost(effect.mEffectID);
            }
```

So if the flag is false, i.e. the function `calcWeakestSchool()` has not been called by an NPC, it retains the base game behaviour.

If the flag is true, i.e. when called by an NPC, then it calls out to `getBaseGameEffectCost()` as defined and used in the section above in this documentation.

Due to how the functions relate to each other, it was also necessary to update `calcAutoCastChance` to hold the same Boolean via header and main file changes as follows,

Header
```
float calcAutoCastChance(const ESM::Spell* spell, const int* actorSkills, const int* actorAttributes, int effectiveSchool, bool useNpcCost = false);
```

Main file
```
    float calcAutoCastChance(const ESM::Spell *spell, const int *actorSkills, const int *actorAttributes, int effectiveSchool, bool useNpcCost)
    {
    ... [rest of function goes here]
```

This is necessary as the function `calcWeakestSchool` can be called directly, or indirectly via `calcAutoCastChance`, so this function too needed updating to be able to hold the Boolean flag

Within `calcAutoCastChance` this line is modified to

```
        else
            calcWeakestSchool(spell, actorSkills, effectiveSchool, skillTerm, useNpcCost); // Note effectiveSchool is unused after this
```

so that when `calcAutoCastChance` calls `calcWeakestSchool`, it is passing it's Boolean flag which is false by default

Within `autoCalcNPCspells` the calls to those two functions are modified to pass true, as follows

```
            calcWeakestSchool(&spell, actorSkills, school, skillTerm, true);

			...

            if (calcAutoCastChance(&spell, actorSkills, actorAttributes, school, true) < fAutoSpellChance)
                continue;
```

Original function

```
    void calcWeakestSchool (const ESM::Spell* spell, const int* actorSkills, int& effectiveSchool, float& skillTerm, bool useNpcCost)
    {
        // Morrowind for some reason uses a formula slightly different from magicka cost calculation
        float minChance = std::numeric_limits<float>::max();
        for (const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect : spell->mEffects.mList)
        {
            const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);

            int minMagn = 1;
            int maxMagn = 1;
            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude))
            {
                minMagn = effect.mMagnMin;
                maxMagn = effect.mMagnMax;
            }

            int duration = 0;
            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration))
                duration = effect.mDuration;
            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::AppliedOnce))
                duration = std::max(1, duration);

            static const float fEffectCostMult = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore()
                .get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fEffectCostMult")->mValue.getFloat();

            float x = 0.5 * (std::max(1, minMagn) + std::max(1, maxMagn));
            x *= 0.1 * magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            x *= 1 + duration;
            x += 0.05 * std::max(1, effect.mArea) * magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            x *= fEffectCostMult;

            if (effect.mRange == ESM::RT_Target)
                x *= 1.5f;

            float s = 2.f * actorSkills[spellSchoolToSkill(magicEffect->mData.mSchool)];
            if (s - x < minChance)
            {
                minChance = s - x;
                effectiveSchool = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;
                skillTerm = s;
            }
        }
    }
```


becomes

```
    void calcWeakestSchool (const ESM::Spell* spell, const int* actorSkills, int& effectiveSchool, float& skillTerm, bool useNpcCost)
    {
        // Morrowind for some reason uses a formula slightly different from magicka cost calculation
        float minChance = std::numeric_limits<float>::max();
        
        for (const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect : spell->mEffects.mList)
        {
            const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);

            float effectCost = 1.0f;

            if (useNpcCost == false)
            {
                // Player behaviour, use live ESP mBaseCost values
                effectCost = magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
            }
            else
            {
                // NPC fork, use hardcoded base game values as per this function
                effectCost = getBaseGameEffectCost(effect.mEffectID);
            }


            int minMagn = 1;
            int maxMagn = 1;
            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude))
            {
                minMagn = effect.mMagnMin;
                maxMagn = effect.mMagnMax;
            }

            int duration = 0;
            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration))
                duration = effect.mDuration;
            if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::AppliedOnce))
                duration = std::max(1, duration);

            static const float fEffectCostMult = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore()
                .get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fEffectCostMult")->mValue.getFloat();

            float x = 0.5 * (std::max(1, minMagn) + std::max(1, maxMagn));
            x *= 0.1 * effectCost;
            x *= 1 + duration;
            x += 0.05 * std::max(1, effect.mArea) * effectCost;
            x *= fEffectCostMult;

            if (effect.mRange == ESM::RT_Target)
                x *= 1.5f;

            float s = 2.f * actorSkills[spellSchoolToSkill(magicEffect->mData.mSchool)];
            if (s - x < minChance)
            {
                minChance = s - x;
                effectiveSchool = magicEffect->mData.mSchool;
                skillTerm = s;
            }
        }
    }
```

In summary
- `calcWeakestSchool` now has a Boolean flag to set to false by default
- `calcNpcSpells` now calls `calcWeakestSchool` with the Boolean flag set to true
- `calcAutoCastChance` now has a Boolean flag to set to false by default
- `calcNpcSpells` now calls `calcAutoCastChance` with the Boolean flag set to true, and `calcAutoCastChance` calls `calcWeakestSchool` with whatever it's Boolean flag is set to at the point of call
- The sum effect is that all NPC calls to `calcWeakestSchool` result in the Boolean being true, and it calling out to the hard coding function, and all player calls result in the Boolean being false

### 3.17.4, Locking `calcEffectCost()`
`spellpriority.cpp`

`calcEffectCost` modified to carry a Boolean that is false by default

First line,
```
    float calcEffectCost(const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect, const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect = nullptr, bool useNpcCost = false);
```

Main file,
```
    float calcEffectCost(const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect, const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect, bool useNpcCost)
    {
    ... [rest of function goes here]
```

Then in `rateEffect` the call to `calcEffectCost` was modified to be true

```
        rating *= calcEffectCost(effect, magicEffect, true);
```

`rateEffect` is called in many places by `rateEffects`, but it is only used ultimately for NPC decision making in `rateEffect`

Then `calcEffectCost` was modified to have the same internal logic fork change made elsewhere above,

Original,
```
    float calcEffectCost(const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect, const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect, bool useNpcCost)
    {
        const MWWorld::ESMStore& store = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore();
        if (!magicEffect)
            magicEffect = store.get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);
        bool hasMagnitude = !(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude);
        bool hasDuration = !(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration);
        bool appliedOnce = magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::AppliedOnce;
        int minMagn = hasMagnitude ? effect.mMagnMin : 1;
        int maxMagn = hasMagnitude ? effect.mMagnMax : 1;
        int duration = hasDuration ? effect.mDuration : 1;
        if (!appliedOnce)
            duration = std::max(1, duration);
        static const float fEffectCostMult = store.get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fEffectCostMult")->mValue.getFloat();

        float x = 0.5 * (std::max(1, minMagn) + std::max(1, maxMagn));
        x *= 0.1 * magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
        x *= 1 + duration;
        x += 0.05 * std::max(1, effect.mArea) * magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;

        return x * fEffectCostMult;
    }
```

Modified,
```
    float calcEffectCost(const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect, const ESM::MagicEffect* magicEffect, bool useNpcCost)
    {
        const MWWorld::ESMStore& store = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore();
        if (!magicEffect)
            magicEffect = store.get<ESM::MagicEffect>().find(effect.mEffectID);
        bool hasMagnitude = !(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude);
        bool hasDuration = !(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration);
        bool appliedOnce = magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::AppliedOnce;
        int minMagn = hasMagnitude ? effect.mMagnMin : 1;
        int maxMagn = hasMagnitude ? effect.mMagnMax : 1;
        int duration = hasDuration ? effect.mDuration : 1;
        if (!appliedOnce)
            duration = std::max(1, duration);
        static const float fEffectCostMult = store.get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fEffectCostMult")->mValue.getFloat();

        float effectCost = 1.0f;

        if (useNpcCost == false)
        {
            // Player behaviour, use live ESP mBaseCost values
            effectCost = magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
        }
        else
        {
            // NPC fork, use hardcoded base game values as per this function
            effectCost = getBaseGameEffectCost(effect.mEffectID);
        }

        float x = 0.5 * (std::max(1, minMagn) + std::max(1, maxMagn));
        x *= 0.1 * effectCost;
        x *= 1 + duration;
        x += 0.05 * std::max(1, effect.mArea) * effectCost;

        return x * fEffectCostMult;
    }
```



## 3.18 Alchemy overhaul
`alchemy.cpp`
`spellcasting.cpp`

### 3.18.1, Potion weight change

`alchemy.cpp`

Potion weight is no longer the sum of the two ingredients, but instead a value which is hard capped between 0.1 and 1.0, with the result getting progressively lower as you raise your skill.

Potion weight still depends on ingredient weight, using two 0.1 weight ingredients will still produce a 0.1 weight potion even at 1 skill.

In the base game
- No tools affect weight
- Potion weight is the average weight of all ingredients used

**Base game**
Potion weight is the average weight of all ingredients used in the potion
```
    for (TIngredientsIterator iter (beginIngredients()); iter!=endIngredients(); ++iter)
        if (!iter->isEmpty())
            newRecord.mData.mWeight += iter->get<ESM::Ingredient>()->mBase->mData.mWeight;

    if (countIngredients() > 0)
        newRecord.mData.mWeight /= countIngredients();

```

**The new weight logic**
```
    if (countIngredients() > 0)
    {
        newRecord.mData.mWeight /= countIngredients();
        float weightHolder = newRecord.mData.mWeight;
        weightHolder = std::min(weightHolder, 1.0f);
        float weightReduction = getAlchemyFactor();
        weightReduction /= 100.0f;
        weightHolder -= weightReduction;
        weightHolder = std::max(weightHolder, 0.1f);
        newRecord.mData.mWeight = weightHolder;
    }
```

This means that no potion can weight more than 1.0, or less than 0.1.
The average weight is still used, so light ingredients result in lighter potions still.
Your alchemy factor `(skill + int/10 + luck/10)` is divided by 100, and that amount is subtracted from the capped weight of 1.0.

So if you had 40 luck, 30 int, and 30 alchemy, your alchemy factor would be 37.
If you made a potion with an average weight of 10, it's final weight would be 0.63, as it would first be capped to 1.0, then 37/100 would be subtracted.
Whereas if you made a potion with an average weight of 0.3, it would have a final weight of 0.1, as first it would be reduced to -0.07, then it would be floored to 0.1.

So your skill and attributes help reduce potion weight, heavier potions take longer to mitigate, lighter ingredients still have an inherent advantage, but eventually a master alchemist can make any set of ingredients into a 0.1 strength potion.

Since potion weight is capped at 1 in the calculations before reduction apply, it doesn't matter what the original potion weight would have been if it would be above 1. The same skill is needed to mitigate the carry weight of an originally 20 weight potion, or a 2 weight potion.


### 3.18.2, Potions no longer stack
`spellcasting.cpp`

This block
```
    bool CastSpell::cast(const ESM::Potion* potion)
    {
        mSourceType = SourceType::Potion;
        mSourceName = potion->mName;
        mId = potion->mId;
        mStack = true;

        inflict(mCaster, mCaster, potion->mEffects, ESM::RT_Self);

        return true;
    }
```

changed to
```
    bool CastSpell::cast(const ESM::Potion* potion)
    {
        mSourceType = SourceType::Potion;
        mSourceName = potion->mName;
        mId = potion->mId;
        mStack = false;

        inflict(mCaster, mCaster, potion->mEffects, ESM::RT_Self);

        return true;
    }
```

The line
```
mStack = false;
```

means that the same potion will no longer stack.

So now if you drink 10 of the same healing potion using hotkeys, it does nothing except refresh the potion.
You can still drink 10 different potions to stack the effects, if you really want.


### 3.18.3, Potion making success rate
`alchemy.cpp`

**Base game**
```
    if (getAlchemyFactor() < Misc::Rng::roll0to99())
    {
        removeIngredients();
        return Result_RandomFailure;
    }
```

Where `AlchemyFactor` is skill + (luck/10) + (intelligence/10)

This results in very poor success rates for most of the early game, prohibitively so, and you reaching 100% about skill 80-90 depending on your attributes.

**New code**
```
    float successChance = 30.0f;
    successChance += ( getAlchemyFactor() / 1.5f);
    successChance = std::max(successChance, 30.0f);

    if (successChance < Misc::Rng::roll0to99())
    {
        removeIngredients();
        return Result_RandomFailure;
    }
```

The result is,
- Success chance is floored to a minimum of 30%
- Then it adds 2/3 of your alchemy factor as a %
- The result is that 
	- At 5 skill you have about a 40% success rate
	- At 30 skill you have about a 55% success rate
	- You reach 100% success rate at about 80 skill, depending on your attributes

It might appear that you still cannot make a potion at all at very low skills sometimes, but this is due to your alchemy factor being so low that you fail to generate any magnitude or duration of effect (even if you correctly use two ingredients with a matching effect).

This value is then modified by the average quality (gold value) of ingredients you use in the potion,

Within the function `MWMechanics::Alchemy::Result MWMechanics::Alchemy::createSingle ()`

The following block was added, to get the average ingredient value

```
    int numberIngredients = countIngredients();
    int sumIngredientValue = 0;
    for (TIngredientsIterator it = beginIngredients(); it != endIngredients(); ++it)
    {
        if (it->isEmpty()) continue;

        auto *wrap = it->get<ESM::Ingredient>();
        if (!wrap) continue;

        auto *base = wrap->mBase;
        if (!base) continue;

        sumIngredientValue += base->mData.mValue;
    }

    float averageIngredientValue = 0.0f;

    if ((sumIngredientValue > 0) && (numberIngredients > 0))
    {
        averageIngredientValue = static_cast<float>(sumIngredientValue) / static_cast<float>(numberIngredients);
    }
```

Then later in the same function I added

```
    float itemSuccessAddition = 0.0f;

    if (averageIngredientValue >= 10.0f)
    {
        itemSuccessAddition = (0.158f * averageIngredientValue);
        itemSuccessAddition += 8.42f;
    }

    successChance += itemSuccessAddition;
```

This is a straight line equation which converts the average gold value of the items to a flat addition to your potion making success rate.

| Avg item value | +Success % |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| 10             | +10        |
| 25             | +12        |
| 100            | +24        |
| 200            | +40        |

It's not perfect, but I went with a straight line instead of another polynomial to save time, and to make it more understandable.

This function can be summarised as,
- Average item value multiplied by 0.158, + 8.4

### 3.18.4, Modifying alchemy factor based on ingredient quality
`alchemy.cpp`

This system gets the average value of all ingredients used in a potion, and increases or decreases the players alchemy factor based on what it gets

**Get the average gold value of the ingredients being used**
```
    //dwemer coda, ingredient value logic
    int numberIngredients = countIngredients();

    std::vector<int> ingredientValues;

    for (TIngredientsIterator it = beginIngredients(); it != endIngredients(); ++it)
    {
        if (it->isEmpty()) continue;

        auto *wrap = it->get<ESM::Ingredient>();
        if (!wrap) continue;

        auto *base = wrap->mBase;
        if (!base) continue;

        int value = base->mData.mValue;

        ingredientValues.push_back(value);
    }
    // the above iterates over the ingredients, checks they exist, gets their base ID, and adds their value to the vector

    int sumIngredientValue = 0;
    for (int v : ingredientValues) sumIngredientValue += v;
    // add them all up into sumIngredientValue as an int

    //dwemer coda end

```

**Use the average value to modify the alchemy factor**
```
    // general alchemy factor
    float x = getAlchemyFactor();

    float averageIngredientValue = 0.0f;
    float priceMod = 0.0f;
    float multMod = 1.0f;
    
    //average the ingredient values with guarding against 0s
    //then work out benefit from tiers and apply
    if ((sumIngredientValue > 0) && (numberIngredients > 0))
    {
        averageIngredientValue = (sumIngredientValue / numberIngredients);

        if (averageIngredientValue < 5.0f)
        {
            multMod = 0.7f;
        }
        else if ((averageIngredientValue >= 5.0f) && (averageIngredientValue < 200.0f))
        {
            // y = 64.46238 + (-293895.7 - 64.46238)/(1 + (x/3.767532e-32)^0.116272)
            // where y is skill boost, and x is ingredient value

            float yf = 64.5f + (-293960.0f / (1.0f + std::powf(averageIngredientValue / 3.76e-32f, 0.11627f)));
            priceMod += yf;
        }
        else if (averageIngredientValue >= 200.0f)
        {
            priceMod = 30.0f;
            float highValueHolder = (averageIngredientValue - 200.0f);
            highValueHolder /= 10.0f;
            priceMod += highValueHolder;
        }

        if (averageIngredientValue >= 100.0f)
        {
            multMod = 1.1f;
        }
    }

    if (sumIngredientValue == 0.0f)
    {
        multMod = 0.7f;
    }

    x += priceMod;
    x *= multMod;
```

Summary of changes
- If the average value of alchemy ingredients used is less than 5g, take a -30% penalty to your alchemy factor
- If the average value is,
- 5-10g, gain between a +10 and a +15 bonus to your effective alchemy skill
- 10-25g, gain between a +15 and a +20 bonus
- 25-100g, gain between a +20 and a +25 bonus
- 100-200g, gain between a +25 and a +30 bonus, along with an additional 10% bonus to alchemy factor after the addition
- 200g+, gain a +30 up to a (average value of items - 200) / 10 bonus to your alchemy skill, so e.g. at 200 you gain +30, at 300 you gain +40, etc (there are very few ingredients even in TR that exceed 200, so this is an edge case and a reward if you decide to use something really valuable for a one shot potion. Still probably not worth it though!)
	- In addition, as with the 100-200g range, gain an additional 10% bonus to alchemy factor after the addition

Up to 200, this is governed by a non-linear line equation, which is simplified in the above code from
```
y = 64.46238 + (-293895.7 - 64.46238)/(1 + (x/3.767532e-32)^0.116272)
```

The overall effect is that
- Using cheap (sub 5g value) ingredients results in weaker potions at all skill levels
- Using more expensive in ingredients results in stronger potions, which is most notable at low levels
- The highest values of ingredients, an average of 100g+, adds a flat +10% modifier in addition at a flat skill boost, so that even at very high skill/factor they have an effect

### 3.18.5, Reduce the impact of the mortar
`alchemy.cpp`

Aim: Make mortar quality above or below 1.0 have 50% less of an effect, to stop stacking equipment and ingredients resulting in way too strong potions at the high end

**Original code**
```
    // general alchemy factor
    float x = getAlchemyFactor();

    x *= mTools[ESM::Apparatus::MortarPestle].get<ESM::Apparatus>()->mBase->mData.mQuality;
```

**New code**
- Does it what it says, mortar quality now has 50% less of an impact if it is below or above 1.0
```
    // general alchemy factor
    float x = getAlchemyFactor();

    // begin step down mortar effectiveness, dwemer coda
    float mortarQuality = mTools[ESM::Apparatus::MortarPestle].get<ESM::Apparatus>()->mBase->mData.mQuality;

    float mortarModifier = 1.0f;
    float qHolder = 1.0f;

    if (mortarQuality < 1.0f)
    {
        qHolder = (1.0f - mortarQuality);
        qHolder /= 2.0f;
        qHolder = (1.0f - qHolder);
        mortarModifier = qHolder;
    }

    if (mortarQuality > 1.0f)
    {
        qHolder = (mortarQuality - 1.0f);
        qHolder /= 2.0f;
        qHolder += 1.0f;
        mortarModifier = qHolder;
    }

    x *= mortarModifier;

    // end step down mortar effectiveness, dwemer coda
```

### 3.18.6, Switch potion making to a magicka costed system
`alchemy.cpp`

**Part one, converting alchemy factor into a magicka budget**
Magicka budget = alchemy factor / 6

Reasoning: you cannot reasonably have an alchemy factor of less than 12 (skill 5, intelligence 30, luck 40), so you will always start with a minimum potion spell cost equivalent of 2.

So at 100 alchemy, luck, and intelligence, you will be making 20 magicka costed potions (assuming you don't have fancy tools by then, which you will)

**Base game behaviour**
Using the value for x calculated so far (which is the alchemy factor modified by the GMST and mortar quality),
```
float magnitude = (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude) ?
    1.0f : (x / fPotionT1MagMul) / magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
float duration = (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration) ?
    1.0f : (x / fPotionT1DurMult) / magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost;
```
Other than that, the rest of the function is applying the tools (which multiply these values by x, as determined by tools) and formatting the data into a final effect list 

**New behaviour**
```
float potionMagickaBudget = (x / 6.0f);

float vHolderOne = (potionMagickaBudget / magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost);
vHolderOne *= 40.0f;
float durHolder = sqrtf(vHolderOne);
float magHolder = (durHolder / 2.0f);

// dwemer coda budget to effect converter end

float magnitude = (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude) ?
            1.0f : magHolder;
float duration = (magicEf
```
- Divides alchemy factor by 6 to get a magicka budget
- Uses the above equation to 'spend' the magicka budget of the alchemy result equally on duration and magnitude, as if you were casting an equivalent spell made with the spellmaking system

**If the potion effect is missing either it's magnitude or duration**

Some effects like water walking have a fixed magnitude of 1, so to properly mirror the spellmaking logic a fork in the above calculations has been added to account for this.

Went back to the original magnitude/duration budgeting code and did this,
```
        // dwemer coda budget to effect converter start

        float vHolderOne = (potionMagickaBudget / magicEffect->mData.mBaseCost);
        vHolderOne *= 40.0f;
        float durHolder = sqrtf(vHolderOne);
        float magHolder = (durHolder / 2.0f);

        //override duration to budget over two, if the effect has no magnitude
        if (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude)
        {
            durHolder = (vHolderOne / 2.0f);
        }

        //override magnitude to budget over two, if the effect has no duration
        if (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration)
        {
            magHolder = (vHolderOne / 4.0f);
        }

        // dwemer coda budget to effect converter end

        float magnitude = (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude) ?
            1.0f : magHolder;
        float duration = (magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration) ?
            1.0f : durHolder;
```

### 3.18.7, Adjusted behaviour for all other tools
`alchemy.cpp`

The full original function
```
void MWMechanics::Alchemy::applyTools (int flags, float& value) const
{
    bool magnitude = !(flags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude);
    bool duration = !(flags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration);
    bool negative = (flags & ESM::MagicEffect::Harmful) != 0;

    int tool = negative ? ESM::Apparatus::Alembic : ESM::Apparatus::Retort;

    int setup = 0;

    if (!mTools[tool].isEmpty() && !mTools[ESM::Apparatus::Calcinator].isEmpty())
        setup = 1;
    else if (!mTools[tool].isEmpty())
        setup = 2;
    else if (!mTools[ESM::Apparatus::Calcinator].isEmpty())
        setup = 3;
    else
        return;

    float toolQuality = setup==1 || setup==2 ? mTools[tool].get<ESM::Apparatus>()->mBase->mData.mQuality : 0;
    float calcinatorQuality = setup==1 || setup==3 ?
        mTools[ESM::Apparatus::Calcinator].get<ESM::Apparatus>()->mBase->mData.mQuality : 0;

    float quality = 1;

    switch (setup)
    {
        case 1:

            quality = negative ? 2 * toolQuality + 3 * calcinatorQuality :
                (magnitude && duration ?
                2 * toolQuality + calcinatorQuality : 2/3.0f * (toolQuality + calcinatorQuality) + 0.5f);
            break;

        case 2:

            quality = negative ? 1+toolQuality : (magnitude && duration ? toolQuality : toolQuality + 0.5f);
            break;

        case 3:

            quality = magnitude && duration ? calcinatorQuality : calcinatorQuality + 0.5f;
            break;
    }

    if (setup==3 || !negative)
    {
        value += quality;
    }
    else
    {
        if (quality==0)
            throw std::runtime_error ("invalid derived alchemy apparatus quality");

        value /= quality;
    }
}
```

**New version and changed**
The logic has overall been simplified,
- The retort multiplies the duration and magnitude of positive effects by `1+(retortQuality/10)`
	- So in practise, +5% at 0.5 Quality up to +20% at 2.0 Quality
- The calcinator boosts positive effects and negative effects, but negative effects more strongly (as a trade-off, hopefully making negative effects matter sometimes)
	- Same positive boost as Retort, +5% at 0.5 Quality up to +20% at 2.0 Quality
	- Three times that boost to negative effects, +15% at 0.5 Quality up to +60% at 2.0 Quality
- The alembic reduces negative effects via `effect * (1.0f-(alembicQuality*0.4))`
	- -20% at 0.5 quality, up to -80% at 1.5 quality
	- Hard cap of a 90% reduction at about 2.25 quality, only achievable if you have modded tools (the hard cap is to stop negative values occurring)

```
void MWMechanics::Alchemy::applyTools(int flags, float& value) const
{
    bool magnitude = !(flags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude);
    bool duration = !(flags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration);
    bool negative = (flags & ESM::MagicEffect::Harmful) != 0;

    if (!mTools[ESM::Apparatus::Calcinator].isEmpty())
    {
        float calcinatorQuality = mTools[ESM::Apparatus::Calcinator].get<ESM::Apparatus>()->mBase->mData.mQuality;
        if (negative == true)
        {
            calcinatorQuality /= (10.0f / 3.0f);
            calcinatorQuality += 1.0f;

    }

            float alembicMod = (0.4f * alembicQuality);
            alembicMod = (1.0f - alembicMod);
            alembicMod = std::max(0.1f, alembicMod);
            value *= alembicMod;
        }
    }

            float retortQuality = mTools[ESM::Apparatus::Retort].get<ESM::Apparatus>()->mBase->mData.mQuality;
            retortQuality /= 10.0f;
            retortQuality += 1.0f;
            value *= retortQuality;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.18.8, Capping potion values at sum cost of ingredients
`alchemy.cpp`

Aim: Cap the value of a potion the player makes by the sum value of the ingredients used in the potion

Just did this
```
    // potion value, with dwemer coda cap added
    mValue = static_cast<int> (
        x * MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>().find ("iAlchemyMod")->mValue.getFloat());
    mValue = std::min(mValue, sumIngredientValue);
```

Only the `std::min` addition was new by me. It uses the sum ingredient value variable that was established above as part of the item value logic

**Comments:**
- This is a harsh cap, and means that you can never make money from alchemy by mass buying and processing ingredients. But this was intentional, to stop any exploitative gameplay loops.
	- The only problem with this first version, is that it is not realistic. You should be able to make money selling powerful healing potions, people would be willing to pay more than the base ingredients are worth. So this is something to revisit after some playtesting.

### 3.18.9, Reducing XP gained from cheap ingredient potions
`alchemy.cpp`

Aim: XP gain from making a potion scales with either average item value, or sum item value, or there is just a penalty below a certain value and skill. In essence, I want to make spamming 1g potions non-viable past a certain point, and I want to reward using high value ingredients in potions with more XP.

The base function which adds to player skill is

```
void MWMechanics::Alchemy::increaseSkill()
{
    mAlchemist.getClass().skillUsageSucceeded (mAlchemist, ESM::Skill::Alchemy, 0);
}
```

I've commented out the call for this function `createSingle`, and instead moved the above line into the `createSingle` function, where the information about ingredient values is already available

Then it does this

```
    float alchemySkill = mAlchemist.getClass().getSkill(mAlchemist, ESM::Skill::Alchemy);

    float alchXpMod = 1.0f;

    //reduction in XP from potions with avg ingredient values less than 5gp
    //to reduce the 1gp ingredient spamming
    //even this might be too generous
    if (averageIngredientValue < 5.0f)
    {
        alchXpMod = 0.5f;

        if (alchemySkill > 30.0f)
        {
            alchXpMod = 0.25f;
        }

        if (alchemySkill > 60.0f)
        {
            alchXpMod = 0.125f;
        }

        if (alchemySkill > 90.0f)
        {
            alchXpMod = 0.05f;
        }
    }

    mAlchemist.getClass().skillUsageSucceeded(mAlchemist, ESM::Skill::Alchemy, 0, alchXpMod);
    //increaseSkill();
```

The end result is that,
If average potion ingredient value is less than 5gp,
- You earn 50% of the normal XP if skill 30 or below
- You earn 25% of the normal XP if skill 30 to 60
- You earn 12.5% of the normal XP if skill 60 to 90
- You earn 5% of the normal XP if skill 90+

### 3.18.10, GMST value and behaviour changes
`alchemy.cpp`

To simplify the base game logic I have set `fPotionStrengthMult` to 1.0. 
- This still acts as in the base game as a % potion strength multiplier, but the new system is balanced around this being 1.0.

`fPotionT1MagMult` and `fPotionT1DurMult` were both changed to 1.0.
- These two have had their function changed from the base game, they both act as % modifiers, with 1.0 being 100%, as `fPotionStrengthMult` behaves

Right after tools are applied, and right before it rounds the values, the effect duration and magnitudes are multiplied by these values.

```
        if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoMagnitude))
            applyTools (magicEffect->mData.mFlags, magnitude);

        if (!(magicEffect->mData.mFlags & ESM::MagicEffect::NoDuration))
            applyTools (magicEffect->mData.mFlags, duration);

        duration *= fPotionT1DurMult;
        magnitude *= fPotionT1MagMul;

        duration = roundf(duration);
        magnitude = roundf(magnitude);
```

Since the spell making logic is (magnitude x 2) x duration, to generate effect cost, if you want to adjust that ratio for potions you just need to change the two GMSTs whilst respecting the ratio.

## 3.21, More XP from casting expensive spells
`spellcasting.cpp`


Original code, within `bool CastSpell::cast(const ESM::Spell* spell)`

```
if (!mManualSpell && mCaster == getPlayer() && spellIncreasesSkill(spell))
	mCaster.getClass().skillUsageSucceeded(mCaster, spellSchoolToSkill(school), 0);
```

New code

```
        //dwemer coda, more XP from high costed spells

        float xpMult = 1.0f;
        float spellCost = spell->mData.mCost;

        if (spellCost > 5.0f)
        {
            xpMult = (spellCost * 0.0889f);
            xpMult += 0.556f;
        }

        if (!mManualSpell && mCaster == getPlayer() && spellIncreasesSkill(spell))
            mCaster.getClass().skillUsageSucceeded(mCaster, spellSchoolToSkill(school), 0, xpMult);

        //end of dwemer coda, more XP from high costed spells
```

## 3.23, Willpower change (buff)
`spellutil.cpp`
`spellcasting.cpp`
`inventorystore.cpp`

**Willpower: spell success**
`spellutil.cpp`
- Increased benefit to spellcasting success by x1.5
	- Previously 50 willpower added 10% success (before fatigue mod)
		- Now it adds 15% (before fatigue mod)


In `calcSpellBaseSuccessChance` in `spellutil.cpp`, added a 1.5x multiplier for the player only

```
        float actorWillpower = stats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Willpower).getModified();
        float actorLuck = stats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Luck).getModified();

        if (actor == player)
        {
            actorWillpower *= 1.5f;
        }

        float castChance = (lowestSkill - spell->mData.mCost + 0.2f * actorWillpower + 0.1f * actorLuck);

        return castChance;
```


**Willpower: Resist magicka**
`spellcasting.cpp`
`inventorystore.cpp`

Within `spellcasting.cpp`, the magic resist capping system was modified to include a conversion of willpower to magic resist.

For every 5 points of willpower above 50, add 1% magic resistance.
- So at 100 willpower, your character has an invisible +10% resist magicka

modification to function

```
            // Start of dwemercoda resistance caps

            if (target == getPlayer())
            {
                int effectholder = 1;
                effectholder = effectIt->mEffectID;

                float magcap = 0.4f;

                //sub system to add 10% of willpower to magic resist
                MWWorld::Ptr player = getPlayer();
                const MWMechanics::CreatureStats &playerStats = player.getClass().getCreatureStats(player);
                float playerWill = playerStats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Willpower).getModified();
                float willMagicResist = 0.0f;

                if (playerWill > 50.0f)
                {
                    playerWill -= 50.0f;
                    willMagicResist = (playerWill / 500.0f);
                }

                //check for drain effects
                if (effectholder == 17 || effectholder == 18 || effectholder == 19 || effectholder == 20 || effectholder == 21)
                {
                    magnitudeMult -= willMagicResist;
                    if (magnitudeMult < magcap)
                    {
                        magnitudeMult = magcap;
                    }
                }
```

and it just repeats the

```
                {
                    magnitudeMult -= willMagicResist;
                    if (magnitudeMult < magcap)
                    {
                        magnitudeMult = magcap;
                    }
                }
```

logic for every group of MR effect checks

The same was done in `inventorystore.cpp`, as had to be done with the original willpower capping, as magic items with constant effects are handled separately here.

Within `void MWWorld::InventoryStore::updateMagicEffects(const Ptr& actor)`

```
 if (!existed)
            {
                params.resize(enchantment.mEffects.mList.size());

                int i=0;
                for (const ESM::ENAMstruct& effect : enchantment.mEffects.mList)
                {
                    int delta = effect.mMagnMax - effect.mMagnMin;
                    // Roll some dice, one for each effect
                    if (delta)
                        params[i].mRandom = Misc::Rng::rollDice(delta + 1) / static_cast<float>(delta);
                    // Try resisting each effect
                    params[i].mMultiplier = MWMechanics::getEffectMultiplier(effect.mEffectID, actor, actor);

                    // Start of dwemercoda resistance caps

                    float magcap = 0.4f;

                    //sub system to add 10% of willpower to magic resist
                    MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();
                    const MWMechanics::CreatureStats &playerStats = player.getClass().getCreatureStats(player);
                    float playerWill = playerStats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Willpower).getModified();
                    float willMagicResist = 0.0f;

                    if (playerWill > 50.0f)
                    {
                        playerWill -= 50.0f;
                        willMagicResist = (playerWill / 500.0f);
                    }

                    // Check for drain effects
                    if (effect.mEffectID == 17 || effect.mEffectID == 18 || effect.mEffectID == 19 || effect.mEffectID == 20 || effect.mEffectID == 21)
                    {
                        params[i].mMultiplier -= willMagicResist;
                        params[i].mMultiplier = std::max(magcap, params[i].mMultiplier);
                    }

```

and the same for all the other sequential groups of magical effect checks.

## 3.25, Hand to Hand changes
`combat.cpp`
`npc.cpp`
`creature.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.hpp`

### 3.25.1, Accuracy

This change has not been made here, it was done during the original melee accuracy pass, but I have included it as a reminder of what was done there.

**Hand to hand accuracy**
Tested and confirmed that hand to hand accuracy is also captured in the new weapon accuracy logic, so hand to hand combat accuracy is,
```
Accuracy = (Hand to hand skill*0.7)+(Agility/5)+(Luck/10)
Accuracy *= fatigue mod
Accuracy += fortify attack
Accuracy -= blind
Accuracy += 20
```
So it has a higher floor, and scales slower. This is the same code used for weapon accuracy.

### 3.25.2, Damage done at low skill levels
`combat.cpp`

Since in core the damage done by hand to hand is derived from your skill multiplied by your attack draw strength, you do trivial amounts of damage at low skill.

For example, given that a fully drawn attack caps out at a 0.5x multiplier,
- Skill 5 = 2.5 fatigue damage
- Skill 10 = 5
- Skill 20 = 10
- Skill 30 = 15
The logic was changed as below to be 10 + (your skill x 0.9),
which is then modified by the draw strength as in core, resulting in
- Skill 5 = 7.25 fatigue damage
- Skill 10 = 9.5
- Skill 20 = 14
- Skill 30 = 18.5
- It then becomes roughly equivalent to core behaviour from skill 40 onwards, scaling a little slower overall and reaching the same final damage value at 100 skill.
- Beyond 100 skill this does result in a reduction in damage gained from skill, but that is probably desirable due to the linear scaling already resulting in potentially absurd figures with some fortify skill effects

Within `combat.cpp`
Within the function `void getHandToHandDamage`

The first few lines were changed to
```
    void getHandToHandDamage(const MWWorld::Ptr &attacker, const MWWorld::Ptr &victim, float &damage, bool &healthdmg, float attackStrength)
    {
        const MWWorld::ESMStore& store = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore();
        float minstrike = store.get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fMinHandToHandMult")->mValue.getFloat();
        float maxstrike = store.get<ESM::GameSetting>().find("fMaxHandToHandMult")->mValue.getFloat();
        damage  = (0.9f * (static_cast<float>(attacker.getClass().getSkill(attacker, ESM::Skill::HandToHand))));
        damage += 10.0f;
        damage *= minstrike + ((maxstrike-minstrike)*attackStrength);
```

Whereas before damage was just equal to your skill

### 3.25.3, Fatigue damage difficulty based scaling
`npc.cpp`
`creature.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.cpp`
`difficultyscaling.hpp`

This section changes it so that fatigue damage dealt by the player is reduced by difficulty setting (this was missed during my original difficulty scaling pass, and is not scaled at all in the core game), and fatigue damage taken is increased by difficulty scaling.
This involved the creation of a a new function in `difficultyscaling.cpp`, and update to it's header file `difficultyscaling.hpp`, and guarding and calls to the new function in both `npc.cpp` and `creature.cpp` (since each of creatures and NPC hand to hand attacks are handled elsewhere in the code, both when they are attacking or defending).

The reason for a new difficulty scaling function was because
- Fatigue damage taken is not reduced by armour, so it was too high if it was given the conventional melee damage taken 1-5x scaling
- Fatigue damage dealt has to overcome the targets passive fatigue regen, so lower values for damage dealt result in potentially being unable to reduce target fatigue at all (which was seen on the highest difficulties)

In `difficultyscaling.hpp`:
A new function was registered
```
float scaleHandDamage(float damage, const MWWorld::Ptr& attacker, const MWWorld::Ptr& victim);
```
This is an identical copy of the normal scale damage function, but with a new name

In `difficultyscaling.cpp`, the new function was added, again an identical copy of the normal scale damage function, but with new values for the multipliers

```
float scaleHandDamage(float damage, const MWWorld::Ptr& attacker, const MWWorld::Ptr& victim)
{
    const MWWorld::Ptr& player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();

    int tier = difficultyTier();

    float dealMult = 1.0f;
    float takeMult = 1.0f;

    switch (tier)
    {
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        dealMult = 0.85f;
        takeMult = 1.25f;
        break;
    case 3:
        dealMult = 0.70f;
        takeMult = 1.50f;
        break;
    case 4:
        dealMult = 0.50f;
        takeMult = 2.00f;
        break;
    case 5:
        dealMult = 0.33f;
        takeMult = 2.50f;
        break;
    case 6:
        dealMult = 0.25f;
        takeMult = 3.00f;
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }

    if (attacker == player)
    {
        damage *= dealMult;
    }
    else if (victim == player)
    {
        damage *= takeMult;
    }

    return damage;
}
```

This results in,

| Tier | % Melee/<br>on-hit dealt | % Melee <br>taken | % Magic/ench<br>damage dealt | % Magic<br>taken | Fatigue dealt | Fatigue taken |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 100                      | 100               | 100                          | 100              | 100           | 100           |
| 2    | 75                       | 150               | 85                           | 125              | 85            | 125           |
| 3    | 50                       | 200               | 70                           | 150              | 70            | 150           |
| 4    | 30                       | 300               | 50                           | 200              | 50            | 200           |
| 5    | 20                       | 400               | 33                           | 250              | 33            | 250           |
| 6    | 15                       | 500               | 25                           | 300              | 25            | 300           |
The numbers are the result of some initial playtesting, and may need refining. Also note for now they are just a duplicate of the magic damage scaling values (which have seemed to be okay from some initial testing).

Within `npc.cpp`,
Within the else fork (else covers if `isHealth` if false) of `onHit`
```
        else
        {
            //add difficulty based scaling for H2H fatigue damage taken and dealt
            if (!attacker.isEmpty() && !godmode)
                if (damage > 0)
                {
                    damage = scaleHandDamage(damage, attacker, ptr);
                }

```
before my custom player/NPC fork, and regardless of it, the damage is now scaled as per the hand to hand function. The check for damage greater than 0 may be strictly necessary, but there are a few calls in the engine to the `onHit` function from non-attack sources which pass `isHealth = false` and damage = 0. So I added the check for, is damage greater than 0, as guarding against strange behaviour versus those calls. Not strictly needed I think, but good futureproofing.

Within `creature.cpp`,
Within the else fork (else covers if `isHealth` if false) of `onHit`
```
            else
            {
                if (!attacker.isEmpty())
                {
                    if (damage > 0)
                    {
                        damage = scaleHandDamage(damage, attacker, ptr);
                    }
                }
                MWMechanics::DynamicStat<float> fatigue(stats.getFatigue());
                fatigue.setCurrent(fatigue.getCurrent() - damage, true);
                stats.setFatigue(fatigue);
            }
```

This is the exact same logic and reasoning as with the NPC file. Note there are some syntax changes, which I inferred from the creature files code for when `isHealth` is true. 
Also, for creatures I didn't check if there are any non-attack sourced calls to this function (as with the NPC function) where `isHealth = false` and damage = 0, but to be safe I put the guarding in anyway as a precaution.

### 3.25.4, Changing Openmw strength scaling behaviour
`combat.cpp`

Openmw adds an optional strength scaling for hand to hand combat. I would like to keep this, and suggest it be toggled on by default, however the way it is implemented is slightly buggy and not in line with how attributes affect other skills.

If the toggle is on, it does
```
damage *= attacker.getClass().getCreatureStats(attacker).getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Strength).getModified() / 40.0f;
```

Which is multiplying your hand to hand damage by your strength over 40, this causes two problems (one likely unintentional)
- At 100 strength you are doing 2.5x hand to hand damage, this seems excessive, and certainly will be as I revise this system
- At damaged strength values below 40, you do massively reduced damage (I assume this is unintentional), e.g. if you are damaged to strength 10, you do 10/40 = 25% of your normal damage
	- Whereas with all weapons in the base game, a strength of 10 would only reduce weapon damage to 60% of the bae value, since that logic is counting values above and below 50

So to fix this, I am changing the strength scaling here to be in line with weapon scaling logic, and to scale based on the strength value above or below 50.

Within `combat.cpp`, within `void getHandToHandDamage`,

Originally it did,
```
        // Options in the launcher's combo box: unarmedFactorsStrengthComboBox
        // 0 = Do not factor strength into hand-to-hand combat.
        // 1 = Factor into werewolf hand-to-hand combat.
        // 2 = Ignore werewolves.
        int factorStrength = Settings::Manager::getInt("strength influences hand to hand", "Game");
        if (factorStrength == 1 || (factorStrength == 2 && !isWerewolf))
        {
        damage *= attacker.getClass().getCreatureStats(attacker).getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Strength).getModified() / 40.0f;
        }
```

Now it does,

```
        // Options in the launcher's combo box: unarmedFactorsStrengthComboBox
        // 0 = Do not factor strength into hand-to-hand combat.
        // 1 = Factor into werewolf hand-to-hand combat.
        // 2 = Ignore werewolves.
        int factorStrength = Settings::Manager::getInt("strength influences hand to hand", "Game");
        if (factorStrength == 1 || (factorStrength == 2 && !isWerewolf))
        {
            //dwemcod, change str scaling to behave like weapon scaling does in core
            float attackerStrength = attacker.getClass().getCreatureStats(attacker).getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Strength).getModified();
            float strengthMult = 1.0f;
            float strengthHolder = 50.0f;

            //some zero guarding, I don't know If I need it, but better safe than sorry
            attackerStrength = std::max(1.0f, attackerStrength);

            //this doesn't need to be two if statements, the logic is identical, collapse it down when I tidy the code

            if (attackerStrength > 50.0f)
            {
                strengthHolder = (attackerStrength - 50.0f);
                strengthHolder /= 100.0f;
                strengthMult += strengthHolder;
            }

            if (attackerStrength < 50.0f)
            {
                strengthHolder = (attackerStrength - 50.0f);
                strengthHolder /= 100.0f;
                strengthMult += strengthHolder;
            }

            damage *= strengthMult;

            //damage *= attacker.getClass().getCreatureStats(attacker).getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Strength).getModified() / 40.0f;
        }
```

As stated in the comments, the guarding might not be strictly necessary, and the way the code is written is redundant, there's no need for the if forks as the logic works the same above and below 50. I just decided to leave it in for now until I start cleaning things.

## 3.26, Pickpocketing overhaul
`pickpocket.cpp`
`pickpocketitemmodel.cpp`

### 3.26.1, You can no longer get caught when closing the pickpocketing UI
`pickpocket.cpp`

This finish function triggers when you close the menu, previously it was

```
    bool Pickpocket::finish()
    {
        return getDetected(0.f);
    }
```

However this still means you may get caught, as it runs the get detected logic but with an item value of 0.

Now it just does

```
    bool Pickpocket::finish()
    {
        //now the player will never be caught just from closing the window
        return false;
    }
```

So you can never fail closing the item menu

### 3.26.2, Item difficulty is value x1, providing GMST is 1.0. Change to expected GMST value
`pickpocket.cpp`

Updated `pick()` to
```
    bool Pickpocket::pick(MWWorld::Ptr item, int count)
    {
        float stackValue = static_cast<float>(item.getClass().getValue(item) * count);
        float fPickPocketMod = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>()
                .find("fPickPocketMod")->mValue.getFloat();
        float valueTerm = fPickPocketMod * stackValue;

        return getDetected(valueTerm);
    }
```
- Removed the 10x multiplier in the value term equation
- Set the GMST `fPickPocketMod` to 1.0 (up from 0.3 in the base game)
- So now providing the GMST is 1.0, the value term is equal to stack value

### 3.26.3, Updating what items can appear to the player in the NPC inventory window when sneaking
`pickpocketitemmodel.cpp`

Changed the item model function to the following:
```
    PickpocketItemModel::PickpocketItemModel(const MWWorld::Ptr& actor, ItemModel *sourceModel, bool hideItems)
        : mActor(actor), mPickpocketDetected(false)
    {
        MWWorld::Ptr player = MWMechanics::getPlayer();
        mSourceModel = sourceModel;
        //float chance = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Sneak);

        //updated chance logic to better mirror pickpocket success chance logic
        //note however that this does not include the fatigue term, an intentional choice
        //so by balancing around a 50% chance to steal, I am actually setting a baseline chance of 62.5% if the player is full fatigue
        const MWMechanics::CreatureStats &playerStats = player.getClass().getCreatureStats(player);
        float luck = playerStats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Luck).getModified();
        float agility = playerStats.getAttribute(ESM::Attribute::Agility).getModified();
        float sneak = player.getClass().getSkill(player, ESM::Skill::Sneak);
        float chance = (sneak + (agility * 0.2) + (luck * 0.1));


        // gold per skill level logic, will mirror what the steal chances are

        chance *= 5.0f;

        //

        mSourceModel->update();

        // build list of items that player is unable to find when attempts to pickpocket.
        if (hideItems)
        {
            for (size_t i = 0; i<mSourceModel->getItemCount(); ++i)
            {
                const ItemStack& item = mSourceModel->getItem(i);
                MWWorld::Ptr itemPtr = item.mBase;
                if (itemPtr.isEmpty())
                    continue; // don't know if I needed to do this, but it's a robust guarding, I think technically
                              // some NPCs can carry light sources as psuedo items

                int singleValue = itemPtr.getClass().getValue(itemPtr);
                int count = item.mCount;
                float stackValue = static_cast<float>(singleValue) * static_cast<float>(count);

                //float chanceMod = (chance * 10.0f);

                if (stackValue > chance)
                {
                    mHiddenItems.push_back(mSourceModel->getItem(i));
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

and updated the `update()` function

```
    void PickpocketItemModel::update()
    {
        mSourceModel->update();
        mItems.clear();
        for (size_t i = 0; i<mSourceModel->getItemCount(); ++i)
        {
            const ItemStack& item = mSourceModel->getItem(i);

            // Bound items may not be stolen
            if (item.mFlags & ItemStack::Flag_Bound)
                continue;

            // Slight restructure of logic, an attempt at some backend guarding

            bool itemHidden = false;
            for (const ItemStack &h : mHiddenItems)
            {
                if (h.mBase.isEmpty()) continue;
                if (item.mBase.isEmpty()) { itemHidden = false; break; }
                if (h.mBase == item.mBase) { itemHidden = true; break; }
            }
            if (!itemHidden && item.mType != ItemStack::Type_Equipped && !(item.mFlags & ItemStack::Flag_Bound))
                mItems.push_back(item);


            //original logic
            //if (std::find(mHiddenItems.begin(), mHiddenItems.end(), item) == mHiddenItems.end()
            //        && item.mType != ItemStack::Type_Equipped)
            //   mItems.push_back(item);
        }
    }
```

These changes mean that when the player pickpockets, they can only see items up to their pickpocketing term (agi/5 + luck/10 + sneak), multiplied by 5
So at 30 agility, 40 luck and 5 skill, you have a term of 15
This means you can see items up to 75g in value

### 3.26.4, Change to pickpocketing difficulty logic
`pickpocket.cpp`

The `getDetected` function was completely overhauled to

```
    bool Pickpocket::getDetected(float valueTerm)
    {
        float playerTerm = getChanceModifier(mThief);

        float itemValue = valueTerm;

        itemValue = std::max(itemValue, 1.0f);

        float itemDifficulty = (itemValue / 5.0f);

        float difficultyMod = (playerTerm - itemDifficulty);

        difficultyMod *= 1.50f;

        int successChance = 50;

        successChance += static_cast<int>(difficultyMod);

        int iPickMinChance = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>()
            .find("iPickMinChance")->mValue.getInteger();
        int iPickMaxChance = MWBase::Environment::get().getWorld()->getStore().get<ESM::GameSetting>()
            .find("iPickMaxChance")->mValue.getInteger();

        int roll = Misc::Rng::roll0to99();

        successChance = std::min(int(iPickMaxChance), successChance);
        successChance = std::max(int(iPickMinChance), successChance);

        if (successChance > roll)
        {
            return false;
        }
        else
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
```

So now you have a 50% chance (at 1x fatigue mod) to steal anything you can see, providing you aren't seen doing it.

It is balanced around 5g per term.

Every 5g in item value above or below 50%, adds plus or minus 1.5% success chance.

This mean at maximum fatigue, you have a baseline success chance of 62.5%. If you were 25 levels above the items value times 5, then you would never fail at pickpocketing it. So you don't start reliably pickpocketing cheap items until about 20-25 levels above the item value.

The idea with this change is to complement the menu logic, which determines which item appears, so that the player knows that any item they are capable of seeing is one they have a good chance of stealing. This is my way of unhiding the logic a little, without making the player memorise numbers.

## 3.27, Updating server checksum

`dwemercoda_\components\openmw-mp\Version.hpp`

Changes `Version.hpp` at the file path above to,

```
#ifndef OPENMW_VERSION_HPP
#define OPENMW_VERSION_HPP

#define TES3MP_VERSION "0.8.1"
#define TES3MP_PROTO_VERSION 801

#define TES3MP_DEFAULT_PASSW "blankpassword"
#define TES3MP_MASTERSERVER_PASSW "12345"


#endif //OPENMW_VERSION_HPP

```

Working, this now produces a server and client that both have the internal checksum version of 801, instead of 10 for the core tes3mp release.

I have tested and it properly prevents you from connecting with the wrong version to the server, and from using the wrong client on a normal server.

For some reason I decided not to get into, any change at all to the TESMP_VERSION (which is the user facing string) causes the build to fail with fatal errors. So I have left that as is, and as a consequence right now despite the checksum actually being different it still displays the same previous version on the server browser
