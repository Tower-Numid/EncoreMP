# 3, GMSTs

* `fBarterGoldResetDelay` changed to 6.0
	* Effect is that shops reset in 6 hour in game hours (versus 24 hours in base game) for multiplayer reasons (time cannot be advanced without resting in tes3mp)
- `fBribe10Mod` changed to 1
	- Effect is that bribing 10 gold adds 1 effective skill level (versus 35 in base game)
- `fBribe100Mod` changed to 15
	- Effect is that bribing 100 gold adds 15 effective skill level (versus 75 in base game)
- `fDispositionMod` changed to 0.25
	- Effect is that disposition has 1/4 the positive or negative effect on haggling (not bartering) versus the base game
- `fElementalShieldMult` changed to 1.0
	- Increases elemental shield damage from 0.1 per point to 1.0 per point of magnitude (versus 0.1 in the base game)
- `fPCbaseMagickaMult` changed from 1.0 to 1.2
	- This means that all player characters have a baseline intelligence to magicka ratio of 1:1.2, as if every had a baseline of fortify maximum magicka 0.2 points. This stacks additively with all other sources of fortify maximum magicka
- `fPickLockMult` changed from -1.0 to -1.3
	- This makes all locks about 30% harder to pick
- `fSpellMakingValueMult` changed to 20
	- Versus base game value of 7, roughly triples the cost of spellmaking
- `fSpellValueMult` changed to 20
	- Versus base game value of 10, doubles the cost of buying a spell

**Alchemy**
`fPotionStrengthMult` set to 1.0. 
- This still acts as in the base game as a % potion strength multiplier, but the new system is balanced around this being 1.0.

`fPotionT1MagMult` and `fPotionT1DurMult` were both set to 1.0.
- These two have had their function changed from the base game, they both act as % modifiers, with 1.0 being 100%, as `fPotionStrengthMult` behaves

**Hand to Hand**
`fHandtoHandHealthPer` increased to 0.4, from 0.1 in the base game, which results in your hand to hand attacks doing 40% of the fatigue damage they would have dealt, as health damage (when striking a knocked down or paralysed opponent)


**Pickpocketing**
- GMST: `iPickMaxChance` does determine your max pickpocket chance, so if it's 50, your maximum pickpocket chance is 50%
	- Set to 100, up from 75 in the base game, so you can reach 100% success chance with enough skill
- GMST: `iPickMinChance` is claimed to raise your minimum pickpocket chance, and whilst it does do that, it seems to be a little more complicated than just setting the floor to it's value
	- Left at the floor value of 5 (which is practically irrelevant in the new V0.70 logic)
	- But, functionality of the GMST changed so that it is a simple and true flat minimum success chance. You can never have lower than this GMST in success chance
- GMST: `fPickPocketMod` to 1.0 (up from 0.3 in the base game)
	- Functionality broadly the same, but the system assumes a GMST value of 1.0, which is 1x gold value
	- Higher values make it harder to pickpocket, by weighting the value of items more in the new difficulty system, e.g. setting the GMST to 10 means it is 10x harder to pickpocket, by item value. The same is true for sub 1 values

Note functionality changes to `iPickMinChance` and `fPickPocketMod`!

```
[1] Balance all bound weapons by giving them downsides (changing their innate enchantments to something else such as -10 agility or -10 attack, so they become an innacurate but strong option, or -strength or something negative to self on hit)
[2] as above, balance all bound armour by adding unique magical effects, so that the point of using the spell becomes more about getting their weird and unique enchantments rather than the AR bonus - also as part of the dwemer coda ovrerwtite the skin (but not the model) with dwemer metal texture
[3] Addressed at an ESP level in V0.70, although still not entirely happy with them. Pending changes to the server to allow true difficulty behaviour, then will balance accordingly.

Test what happens if I make a sun damaging spell, does it work as I hope?
	Sun damage being positioned as a strictly better option than others if you are outdoors during the day - it cannot be resisted in any way, so is like typeless damage
Poison damage set to 4 to be cheaper than destrution spells, not good enough?
Weaknesses eyeballed at 3x cheaper, except magicka which was only 2x cheaper as deemed to be too good otherwise

* Greater bonewalker effect cost, 15 -> 19

## 7.1, Summoned creatures, specific changes

**Ancestral Ghost (7)**
- +5 health, from 23 to 28
- Added 10 points of passive sanctuary via `dwemcod_summon_ghost_sanctuary`
- Updated spell (unique ID, `dwemcod_Ghost_Curse`) to do 5-15 points damage health, drain endurance 5 points for 30 seconds, and 2 points damage fatigue for 30 seconds
	- Vs original of 1-10 points damage health, drain endurance 5 points for 30 seconds, and drain fatigue 10 points for 30 seconds

Summon niche: Early game evasive summon, weak melee, okay spell damage, damages fatigue a little as well.

Comments on changes: A little more health, and 10 point sanctuary, add to it's survivability. The passive 'ghost effect' gives it 50 chameleon, which comes out to a passive equivalent of 10 points sanctuary already in the base game. These changes position it as an evasive early game summon. The spell was updated to hit a little harder, and the useless 'drain fatigue' effect was changed to a weak damage fatigue for the same duration, making it feel more like a curse (now your opponents will actually hit a little less often after being cursed).

**Scamp (12)**
- Added spell `dwemcod_summon_scamp_blind`
	- Name: Oblivion's Caliginy
	- 10 magicka
	- blind 25 points on touch for 10 seconds
- Lowered magicka (spell points) to 50, so that the scamp can only cast this five times at most

Summon niche: Early game melee 'rogue-like'  summon, with a short duration blinding spell with limited casts. Retains all base game resists, so immune to normal weapons and quite resistant to a lot of magic types.

Comments on changes: I wanted to give the scamp a niche that was distinct from the other early game melee summon, the skeletal minion. The scamp has been positioned as more of a trickster, with a blinding effect. The blinding isn't canonical though, so I don't love it, but it's a coda for a reason.

**Skeletal minion (13)**
- +7 health, from 38 to 45
- Changed iron shield to steel shield, primarily for visuals, practically no mechanical difference
- Random iron weapon changed to `dwemcod_random_silver_weapon`
	- So now they can hit targets immune to normal weapons
	- This new table also has a 1/3 chance of giving the skeleton a silver weapon enchanted with 1-4 frost damage (a steel mace with this enchantment is also on the table, though there is no equivalent silver unenchanted mace)

Summon niche: Melee fighter with blocking and a semi-randomised weapon. Average higher melee output than the scamp as a result.

Comments on changes: They were originally strictly worse than the scamp, this gives them a semi-random weapon which adds more punch. Health was increased to bring them in line with scamp, and the shield was changed for visuals (very little effect mechanically).

**Bonewalker (13)**
- Replaced two drain spells with higher magnitude variants, but kept the same manually defined costs
	- Drain strength 2-4 for 60s becomes drain strength 10-20 for 60s `dwemcod grave curse: strength`
	- Drain endurance 2-4 for 60s becomes drain endurance 10-20 for 60s `dwemcod grave curse: endurance`
- Lowered melee damage slightly from 4-12 to 3-11, making it an average of 7, versus scamp average of 10, so overall 30% less melee damage output
- Kept the very low movement speed (12 speed) and the high health (60)

Summon niche: Slow moving, high health, relatively weak, debuff specialist

Comments on changes: Tried to keep it in niche, just amplified it's ability to drain attributes to something meaningful.

**Greater bonewalker (19)**
- Has a good niche as the damage strength summon, it might be too good at that - but that's a base game issue I haven't addressed for now
- The only change, and problem with the base game spell, was that it's original spell effect cost was (IMO) too low, at 15, so it has been increased to 19
	- For comparison, lesser bonewalker is/was 13, so there was no reason not to use greater bonewalker as soon as you got it. I think it needed to have a jump in cost, given the fact it is a complete shutdown against some enemies with the damage attribute spells.

**Clannfear (22)**
- Speed increased from 14 to 30, it goes fast now due to the model and animation
- Melee increased slightly from 6-18, to 10-20
- Otherwise left as is, no resists, good health (113)

Summon niche: Fast melee hunter, like being torn to pieces by an angry daedra

Comments on changes: Made it fast, and bought the damage up a little (since it has nothing else going for it) to make it's niche a charging murder machine, good versus casters, rangers, and just a little more viable overall as a melee. Still might be too weak overall, but not everything has to be balanced, it's just a good fighter style summon in the midgame.

**Flame atronach (23)**
- Has a good niche as a fire magical dps already
- Lowered AOE from 10ft from 5ft, to make them less likely to hit allies/player, but kept cost the same
	- A new unique spell ID, left core fire bloom as is, `dwemcod_summon_firebloom`

Summon niche: fire magic dps

**Bone lord (25)**
- Replaced the second barrier spell (20pts shield for 30s on self) with a passive ability, shield 20pts. No stronger, but now it doesn't waste time buffing itself when summoned
	- `dwemcod_summon_second_barrier`
- Replaced the useless drain speed 2-4 pts for 60s curse with `dwemcod_grave_curse_bonelord`
	- Drain speed and agility, 10-20 points, for 60s on touch

Summon niche: Undead melee backed up with defensive spells and another potent curse variant

**Frost atronach (27)**
- Has a good niche as a frost magical dps already
- Lowered AOE from 10ft from 5ft, to make them less likely to hit allies/player, but kept cost the same
	- A new unique spell ID, left core frost bloom as is, `dwemcod_summon_frostbloom`

Summon niche: frost magic dps

**Dremora (28)**
- Has a good niche as a melee heavy hitter, has reflect, random weapon table scales with level up to daedric (which gives it very strong dps), also high health
- No changes

**Hunger (29)**
- Removed disintegrate weapons and armour on target
- Added, disintegrate armour 20 points for 30s on touch (cost 30)
	- `dwemcod_summon_hunger_disint`
- Left paralysis as is
- Lowered total magicka to 110 points, to limit paralysis spam potential

Summon niche: Disintegrate and paralysis 'special effect' melee caster

Comments: Base game behaviour is, if enemy has armour/weapons: almost exclusively spam disintegrate, if not: almost exclusively spam paralysis. The change means even against an armoured target, it chooses not to spam disintegrate armour (as it can recognise the effect is still applied and there is no benefit to recasting it), and will prioritise paralysis. The magicka cap of 110 (down from~250) is an initial attempt to stop it being infinite paralysis casts. If it misses disintegrate it will recast that at 30 magicka, hence the still high cap (given paralysis only costs it 10 magicka to cast)

**Daedroth (32)**
- Replaced third barrier (30pts shield for 30s) with a passive 30 point shield ability
	- `dwemcod_summon_third_barrier`
	- Same reason for change as with bonelord, means it gets right into fighting instead of spending time buffing when summoned
- Reduced the AOE on the shock bloom from 10ft to 5ft with new unique ID spell (same as is used for storm atronach)
	- `dwemcod_summon_shockbloom`
- Did the same thing for the poison bloom, new ID, also buffed slightly from 1-20 for 5s to 1-25 for 5s. Why does poison need to always be worse than shock? Poor poison.
	- `dwemcod_summon_poisonbloom`
- Retains the healing, but in practise they rarely cast it as they have normally run out of mana by time they get that injured
	- Something for a future version after some more testing

Niche: Tanky (shield), caster like atronach are, retains the healing spell. Not a huge niche really compared to the other caster summons, but I'm trying not to gamify this too much, it's okay for it just to be a variant mechanically IMO


**Storm Atronach (38)**
- Overall the strongest caster summon, lots of health and a terrifying melee attack
- Lowered AOE from 10ft from 5ft, to make them less likely to hit allies/player, but kept cost the same
	- A new unique spell ID, left core shock bloom as is, `dwemcod_summon_shockbloom`
- Buffed the lightning shield slightly
	- A new unique spell ID, left core shock shield as is, `dwemcod_summon_shock_shield`

**Winged twilight (52)**
- Had no spells or abilities in core, moved to a mysticism/absorption themed anti-magic summon
- Given:
- `dwemcod_summon_spellabsorb`
	- Passive ability, absorb spell 30pts
- `dwemcod_summon_greater_absorb`
	- Spell, absorb health 1-25pts for 5s on target 5ft AOE (40 magicka)

Comments: Possibly too strong, pending server side change to summon logic


**Golden saint (55)**
- The ultimate summon
- Strength increased from 50 to 100, making it do 150% damage
	- The UESP claims that it should be doing weapon + base damage (base damage average of 40), but testing and the code show it is doing just weapon damage in this version of open morrowind
	- Regardless of if it should, it certainly needed a damage boost in this version, as the average weapon damage was only about 30, making it no better at damage than the storm atronach, and not that much ahead the Dremora
	- Now it does an average of 45 a swing, across all it's possible weapons
- Lightning shield (3pts for 30s) replaced with a new variant, 10pts for 30s
- Otherwise left as is, with dispel and the same weapon/shield table
